<span class="pch">THREE CHUMS</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, fellows,” said Frank Haven, “the long vacation is
over at last.”</p>

<p>“And now for school and study,” added Sammy Brown.</p>

<p>“And fun!” echoed Bob Bouncer.</p>

<p>He was well named, was this Bob Bouncer. On this
bright September morning, Bob looked full of vim and go.
He skipped along the pretty village road like the active lad
he was, bounding through life with a laugh and a cheer, and
getting out of it plenty of fun and frolic.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so glum, Sammy!” he cried. “If any fellows
had a grand old vacation to brag of, it’s us three.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so, and no mistake,” replied Sammy. “I’m
not grumbling. I was just wishing that the boating, and the
swimming, and getting wrecked on Pine Island, and that
dandy time in the mountains, could last forever.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bob, “school isn’t going to be a prison, is it?
Especially this school. I found something this morning, and
they say it’s a sign that things will be stirring right along.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Bob?” asked Sammy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“A lucky stone,” replied Bob, with a chuckle, producing
the object in question.</p>

<p>“Maybe it means that you’re going to be put into a
higher class,” spoke Frank, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or that we’re going to get half-holiday Fridays,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“Or that Jed Burr is going to leave school,” put in
Sammy, with a wry grimace.</p>

<p>“Huh! no fear of Jed leaving,” said Bob. “He’ll stick on
till he’s too old to stick any longer, and pester the life out of
every one he meets.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of him, Bob?” asked Sammy, slyly.</p>

<p>“Afraid?” cried Bob. “I guess not! He’s just like a
gnat or a hornet.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to play with him,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to, in the football game,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t at other times. He got me in trouble last
term in a mean, sneaky way, and I won’t give him a chance
again. Tell you one thing, fellows.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that, Sammy?”</p>

<p>“If Jed Burr tries any of his sly tricks on me this term,
he’ll find me ready for him.”</p>

<p>“How ready, Sammy?” asked Bob, with a sharp look at
his comrade.</p>

<p>“That’s a secret,” chuckled Sammy. “But you wait and
see.”</p>

<p>“There’s the half-past bell,” sang out Bob. “Let’s hurry
and see what’s going on before school begins.”</p>

<p>The Fairview schoolhouse was about half a mile from
Bob’s home. He, Frank and Sammy lived near together.
They had taken the bluff road lining Rainbow Lake. Just
beyond the curve they were turning, the schoolhouse would
come into view.</p>

<p>Bob broke into a run, swinging his books at the end of
a strap gaily. Just past the stone wall and the line of trees
shutting out the view, he halted dead short.</p>

<p>“What’s he staring at, I wonder?” said Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t know. Let’s find out,” replied Sammy, and both
hurried on.</p>

<p>“The mischief!” shouted Sammy.</p>

<p>He, too, halted. Frank joined them, and the three lads
for a moment stood looking in wonder down the slanting
road.</p>

<p>“It’s a runaway automobile,” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>“And a boy in it,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“Whew! there’s a tumble,” shouted Bob, dancing up and
down in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>Not fifty feet away from them, near a vacant house, an
automobile was coming towards them. A boy in its front
seat seemed to have been trying to turn around. When Bob
and his chums first caught sight of the machine, they saw
that this boy was trying to stop it, but he did not seem to
know how to go about the task.</p>

<p>In some way he had gotten mixed up on the steering
gear, and the auto crossed the road sideways. As it reached
the edge of the road, its front wheels struck a fallen tree. As
the auto passed over the log, there was a big jolt. The boy
in the machine was lifted up in his seat, and either jumped
or fell flat into a great puddle of mud.</p>

<p>“Frank,” cried Bob, “see where it’s headed!”</p>

<p>“Say, it’s a goner!” gasped Sammy.</p>

<p>Frank was the only one of the three who knew much
about an automobile, and that was very little. An uncle of
his owned a machine, and he had spent a day or two lately
with his relatives at Fairview. Frank had gone on several
runs with his uncle. He had noticed how his relative had
handled the automobile, but in a general way only. As he
ran towards the machine now, he hardly knew what he
should do to stop it.</p>

<p>The runaway automobile was not going very fast. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the way it was headed that made Frank realize that something
must be done. The machine was tearing up the earth,
and running against rocks, and bumping past trees, directly
at the edge of the bluff road.</p>

<p>“If it keeps on that way,” said Frank to himself, “it will
go over the edge of the bluff.”</p>

<p>If that happened the auto would be wrecked. It would
roll over and over down quite a steep slant until it reached
Rainbow Lake.</p>

<p>“Don’t get in! don’t get in!” shouted Sammy, his eyes
nearly bolting out of his head, as he saw no chance to stop
the auto.</p>

<p>Frank could hardly have jumped into the machine, it
wobbled about so. But he reached its side, ran along with
it, and then jumped to the step.</p>

<p>Once Frank had been with his uncle when his auto, turning
a sharp curve, nearly ran into a great load of hay
blocking the road. Frank remembered that his uncle had
acted as quick as lightning. He had shot out his hand and
grasped the side brake, at the same time turning off the
power at the wheel.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow graze,” his uncle had told him, as
the machine stopped short.</p>

<p>He called it “killing the engine.” All this was in
Frank’s mind as he now gave the brake of the runaway auto
a quick wrench and at the same time shoved back the controls
on the steering wheel. As a sway of the auto threw him off
the step, the chug! chug! of the machine stopped, and so did
the auto itself.</p>

<p>The big red car had one wheel wedged between two
rocks. Frank breathed pretty hard as he noticed that had
the auto gone ten feet farther, it would have toppled over
the cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, say, you’ve done a big thing,” panted Sammy,
running up to the spot.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it didn’t go over the bluff,” said Frank.</p>

<p>He might well say this. As he glanced down the slant,
Frank almost became frightened. Three little huts, where
some fishermen and their families lived, were right in the
course the auto might take. Just now some small children
were playing near one of the huts.</p>

<p>“Say, if it hit those houses&mdash;say, if it smashed over those
children&mdash;&mdash;” began Sammy, in a gasp.</p>

<p>“Where is Bob?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s helping the fellow who tumbled out of the auto,”
explained Sammy.</p>

<p>Frank turned around, to see Bob back at the spot where
the boy in the auto had taken his tumble into the mud
puddle.</p>

<p>Bob had helped the boy out of the water and mire. Just
now he was rubbing the mud from his coat with some dry
grass. The victim of the accident was mopping his face
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Here comes the man who owns the automobile, I guess,”
said Sammy.</p>

<p>Frank saw a man rush down the road from the direction
of the vacant house. He was in a great hurry, and excited.
He shouted some words at Bob and his companion, and,
passing Frank and Sammy, gasping for breath, ran to the
automobile.</p>

<p>As he looked it over and saw that he could get it back
into the roadway without risk or damage, he walked up to
the boys.</p>

<p>“One of you stopped that machine,” he said, glancing
from Frank to Sammy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was Frank, mister,” said Sammy, pointing to his
chum.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got much with me,” spoke the man, his voice
trembling.</p>

<p>First he shook Frank’s hand warmly. Then he groped in
his pocket and drew out a bright new silver dollar.</p>

<p>“You take that till I see you again,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Frank. “I don’t want any pay for
doing the little I did.”</p>

<p>“Little!” cried the man, pressing the coin on Frank.
“That machine is worth three thousand dollars, and you
saved it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad if I did,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“If that boy back there was my boy,” spoke the man, with
a look at the lad who had tumbled out of the auto, “I’d either
teach him how to run the machine, or handcuff him when
he was aboard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he your boy?” inquired Sammy.</p>

<p>“No, I’m his father’s chauffeur.”</p>

<p>They all went up to the mud puddle. Bob was helping
his companion get cleaned up in as friendly a way as if they
had been chums for years.</p>

<p>“Why,” shouted Sammy, in blank surprise, “it’s the fat
boy.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” replied Frank, in a wondering tone.</p>

<p>“Hello,” spoke the boy who had tumbled out of the auto.
“You fellows here, too?”</p>

<p>Bob’s face, as were the faces of the others, was set in
a broad smile. They all had good reason to remember “the
fat boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me,” said the victim of the accident, rubbing
some dirt out of one ear. “Is the machine all right, Buxton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the machine is all right,” replied the man; “but ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
feet more, and it would have been all wrong. What was you
trying to do with it, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I thought I would turn it around. I only touched one
little handle, and then the foot-plate, and the pesky auto
wouldn’t go straight at all. Yes, fellows,” smiled the speaker
at Frank and Sammy, “I’m like the bad penny, turned up
again.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you in Fairview,” said Frank. “How
are you getting on at the academy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve quit there,” said Tom Chubb, otherwise “the
fat boy.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“They said I wasn’t far enough along to keep up with
the class.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“You know I don’t know much,” said the fat boy, frankly.
“The fellows all made fun of me. Then they got mad. I
couldn’t hit back when they fought me, I was so fat. Well,
all I could do was to get them in a corner and fall on
them.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Sammy.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good,” chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>“Father is thinking of coming to Fairview to live for the
summer,” went on the fat boy. “I think we’ll take that
vacant house Buxton was just looking at.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, you may come to our school?” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“I reckon I will,” replied the fat boy. “I hope so, for I
like you fellows. Say,” and he grinned from ear to ear,
“remember how you met me in the mountains that night?”</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“How you told me how to get even with the students who
hazed me? Well, I did it great and grand, and I’ll never
forget you for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes the chauffeur got the automobile back
into the road. The fat boy waved his hand to the boys until
the machine turned out of sight.</p>

<p>“Well, who ever thought of meeting that fellow again!”
laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s a comical one,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“He asked if we remembered that night in the mountains,”
said Sammy. “Huh! as if we’d ever forget it.”</p>

<p>Each one of the boys was busy for the moment thinking
of that same night in the mountains. It had brought back
some adventure that had made the long vacation a time of
great delight to them.</p>

<p>Those of my young readers who have read the first book
of the present series, entitled: “Fairview Boys Afloat and
Ashore; Or, The Young Crusoes of Pine Island,” will recall
the exciting but jolly time Frank, Bob and Sammy had when
the sail-boat <i>Puff</i> was wrecked on Pine Island.</p>

<p>The three boys had been allowed to make a one day’s
cruise on Rainbow Lake. They had, however, gotten caught
in a big storm, and were marooned on Pine Island for several
days.</p>

<p>All the time Sammy Brown’s busy head was full of
misers’ hoards and hidden treasure. In the second book of
this series, called “Fairview Boys on Eagle Mountain; Or,
Sammy Brown’s Treasure Hunt,” Sammy induced his two
loyal companions to go with him to Eagle Mountain in search
of a fancied lot of treasure.</p>

<p>The boys had found no treasure. However, they ran
across a stolen horse and got a twenty-five-dollar reward for
returning it to its owner.</p>

<p>It was during the first night of their camping out in the
mountains that they came across the fat boy, Tom Chubb.</p>

<p>Some school chums of his at a distant academy had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Tom believe they were going to let him help them cut down
a bee tree. They induced him to lug along a heavy log chain
nearly ten miles. Then they scurried away, leaving him to
guess the trick that had been played upon him, and to find
his way back home alone at midnight the best way he could.</p>

<p>Bob and his friends had come across Tom, and had
given him food and shelter for the night. Bob had told him
how to get even with the schemers. This was to buy two
pails of fine comb honey from a farmer, and march back with
it to the academy just as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“He did it, fellows,” said Bob now. “He says he gave
the whole school a royal treat, never told a word as to how
he got the honey, and crowed over the fellows who played
the trick till they were as mum as turtles.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a pretty good fellow,” said Frank. “I hope
he comes to our school.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” echoed Sammy. “Here we are.”</p>

<p>A turn in the road brought them in full sight of the
village schoolhouse. They hurried forward eagerly. There
was always a novelty in the first day at school. They looked
over the bright active scene before them with interest.</p>

<p>“Pretty near the same old crowd,” said Sammy. “See,
there’s Nellie Somers.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” spoke Bob, slyly, “how is it you always manage
to see her first, Sammy?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get smart, Bob,” cried Sammy. “Oh, there’s
little Benny Lane.”</p>

<p>“And Jed Burr, big as life,” added Bob. “Look at him,
Frank. I should think he’d get tired of that same old trick
of his.”</p>

<p>“What trick, Bob?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Watch him and see.”</p>

<p>Their eyes were fixed on a boy who was moving from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
place to place on the playground. This was Jed Burr. He
was known as the bully of the school, and, except by a few
chums of his own kind, was not very well liked.</p>

<p>As a new arrival came upon the playground, he would
go up to him and put out his hand as if to welcome him.
Just now an innocent-faced little fellow put out his hand in
response. Jed seized it, gave the boy a quick jerk, and sent
him flat on his face with a great laugh.</p>

<p>Jed spied the three friends as they came up, and hurried
towards them.</p>

<p>“Look out, fellows,” warned Sammy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we know his tricks,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“You know, when he can’t catch a fellow with the hand-shake,”
said Sammy, “he runs up to him when he isn’t looking
and gives him a slap on the back that nearly knocks the
breath out of him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he calls that fun,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“I hope he tries it on me,” said Sammy, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Bob, with a sharp look at Sammy, “what
are you up to?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You just watch me if Jed Burr tries it,”
said Sammy.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Frank!” spoke Jed, reaching out his hand.</p>

<p>“Fine, thank you,” smiled Frank, and he shook his own
hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jed, never better,” laughed Bob, putting his hand
behind him.</p>

<p>Sammy had turned clear around, facing the schoolhouse.
Jed saw this, and his eye brightened. He even drew up his
coat-sleeve, winked at Frank and Bob, stole up behind
Sammy, and, bringing his hand across Sammy’s back, gloated
out:</p>

<p>“Hello, Sammy Brown&mdash;wow! ouch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>A wonderful change came over the face of the school
bully. He drew back his hand as if it had touched red-hot
iron. He wrung it with a pained look on his face.</p>

<p>Sammy turned around, as cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p>“Why, Jed, what’s the matter?” he asked, innocently.</p>

<p>Jed Burr grumbled out something, stuck his hand in his
pocket, and strode away with a scowl on his face.</p>

<p>“What have you been up to, Sammy?” asked Frank, half
guessing.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing but wearing a pin cushion between my
shoulders,” chuckled Sammy in reply.</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang, and the scholars began to flock
into the little schoolhouse.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="pch">THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Frank Haven</span> piloted Benny Lane among the crowding
scholars. The little fellow used a crutch, and some of the
rougher boys nearly swept him off his feet.</p>

<p>“It seems like home again, doesn’t it, Sammy?” whispered
Bob, as they took their places at their old desks.</p>

<p>There was the usual hum and bustle that always took
place on the first day of school.</p>

<p>Miss Williams, the teacher, welcomed all the boys and
girls with a pleasant smile. She gave the scholars time to
settle themselves in their seats before she called the school to
order.</p>

<p>When she finally tapped the little bell on her desk everybody
became quiet, except Jed Burr. He was leaning over
towards Sammy’s desk, mumbling out something about getting
even with him. Miss Williams tapped the desk sharply
with her ruler, and looked right at Jed. He scowled at
Sammy and then at the teacher.</p>

<p>“There will be no school this afternoon,” began Miss
Williams, and there was a great rustling about, and everybody
grew eager and smiling.</p>

<p>“The school board will meet here this afternoon,” went
on the teacher, “so you will have a half holiday.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Sammy to himself.</p>

<p>Bob touched his foot with his own and chuckled.</p>

<p>“This morning you will all come up in your turn and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
your classes and lists for new books,” added Miss Williams.
“The new scholars will come first, please.”</p>

<p>Minnie Grey, a shy little girl whose folks were poor, and
who carried milk and eggs around to sell mornings and
evenings, got her list of books.</p>

<p>She sat right in front of Bob. He could look over her
shoulder and read the list. When he got his own he wrote
and slipped her a note.</p>

<p class="p1">“dear Minie,” it read, “I have got all the books you
nead, and I am threw with them. You can have them after
school.”</p>

<p class="p1">Minnie had been looking over her list very solemnly. The
cost of the books seemed a small fortune to her. She studied
over Bob’s hasty note and her eyes sparkled. Then she wrote
on her slate, and held it up so Bob could read the words:</p>

<p class="p1">“You are a reel gude boy.”</p>

<p class="p1">Jed Burr, who was watching everything Bob did,
snickered. One of his crowd said “cluck-cluck!” in a
whisper. Another one pretended to pull Minnie’s braid of
hair as if it were a cow’s tail, and said “Moo-oo.”</p>

<p>It made Jed madder than ever when he found he would
have to go over the studies of the last term. Bob, Frank
and Sammy were pleased to find that they were promoted to
the third class, and would all have the same studies.</p>

<p>Dave Duncan, who was a leader with the best crowd of
boys, kept busy till recess time making up a list of the football
teams. It got whispered about what he was up to, and
most of the boys were thinking a good deal more of the
coming sport than of their studies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Williams went home at recess time for some reports
she had left in her room. Most of the boys stayed in the
schoolhouse, for Dave was telling of the make-up of the new
teams.</p>

<p>Jed Burr had a good deal to say about it, but Dave settled
it all without his advice. When they had arranged their
plans there were a few minutes left for play. The boys began
chasing each other about the room.</p>

<p>Bob, in dodging a boy who was chasing him, pulled open
a door of a little storeroom just behind the teacher’s desk.
He was intent on hiding, but the other saw his move. Bob
only slipped inside the storeroom, and then sprang out again.</p>

<p>Several times Jed Burr brushed by Sammy and Bob, and
seemed to take a pleasure in bumping up hard against them.
Bob paid no attention to his ugly ways.</p>

<p>Then the teacher came back, and recess was over. There
was half an hour of practising on some school songs. After
that Miss Williams gave out some writing exercises to be
done at home.</p>

<p>She went to the little storeroom to fill an ink-well. Jed
Burr threw a wad of paper at some girls as the teacher’s back
was turned. He jumped on his seat and was getting ready
to go through what he thought was some smart antics, when
Miss Williams cried out sharply, and came back into the
schoolroom.</p>

<p>“Who pushed the large bottle of ink off the table in the
storeroom?” she asked, sternly.</p>

<p>No one replied. There was utter silence as she looked
from face to face.</p>

<p>“Some one did,” went on Miss Williams. “It lies broken
on the floor, and the ink is all over the room.” And necks
were craned to notice her black footmarks from the storeroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Williams waited a moment or two for some one to
speak. Then she asked:</p>

<p>“Has any one of the scholars been in the storeroom this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob Bouncer,” said a quick voice.</p>

<p>Bob knew that it was Jed Burr who had spoken. He
flushed a little, and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I was in the storeroom, but it was only for a second,
Miss Williams,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then you broke the bottle of ink?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I didn’t,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“You must tell the truth, Bob,” said Miss Williams. “If
you broke it by accident, it could not be helped.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t break it at all. I wasn’t near the table. I wasn’t
over a foot inside the room, Miss Williams.”</p>

<p>There was a sniff and a sneer. The word “stuff” was
heard all over the room. Miss Williams looked very sharply
at Bob. Then she touched the bell, with the words:</p>

<p>“School is dismissed. Bob, you may remain.”</p>

<p>Bob looked pretty glum as the other scholars trooped out.
Jed Burr chuckled as he passed him. Little Minnie Grey
was in tears. Frank was angry, and he hurried out after
Jed to give him a piece of his mind.</p>

<p>Miss Williams sat down at her desk and paid no attention
to the lonely scholar left in the room. She knew Bob to be
a good boy, but she knew, too, that he was proud and
stubborn, and never liked to be censured before the whole
school. She hoped that silence and thought would lead Bob
to confess, if he had really spilled the ink.</p>

<p>Bob heard the boys in the distance shouting and playing.
It made him more gloomy than ever to think how they were
planning for the football game that afternoon, and he was
shut out from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Williams went on quietly writing at the desk. Bob
got tired looking around the room. He dropped his head
upon his arms and tried not to feel mean. Miss Williams
thought he was sulking, and did not disturb him. Suddenly
Bob raised his head quickly.</p>

<p>“Sit still, dearie,” spoke a strange voice. “Sit still now,
or I’ll stick you.”</p>

<p>Bob’s eyes opened to their widest. The door of the storeroom
was now open. A woman had come from it. She had
stolen up behind the school teacher without being seen or
heard by Miss Williams.</p>

<p>As she spoke the words that caused Bob to look up, she
grasped the long back hair of the school teacher in one hand.
In the other she waved a long sharp-pointed pair of scissors.</p>

<p>Miss Williams tried to turn around, but the woman kept
a firm hold on the coils of her hair.</p>

<p>“Why, Mary,” spoke the teacher, turning pale, but trying
to act calmly, “how did you come here?”</p>

<p>Bob also knew the woman at a glance. She was called
Simple Mary. Some years before, her husband and child
had been drowned in a great storm on Rainbow Lake. The
shock drove the poor creature out of her mind.</p>

<p>Since then she had had frequent spells, when the authorities
had to shut her up in an asylum. Then she would be
very quiet for weeks at a time, when she would roam about
the country. Some kind-hearted people always gave her
work or shelter.</p>

<p>Bob held his breath, for it was quite startling to see Mary
waving the scissors. Her eyes looked wild, and she was not
in one of her quiet moods, that was certain.</p>

<p>“I’ve been here hiding in the storeroom since before
school,” began Mary, with a sly laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, what for?” asked Miss Williams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“To wait for you.”</p>

<p>“For me, Mary?” said the teacher, as calmly as she
could.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. You see, I expect my little child home
to-night. You know, she has been away at school for nearly
four years.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mary,” replied Miss Williams, humoring the
delusion of the poor mother. “That will be very nice,
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. I’m making her a beautiful doll, and I need
some hair for its head. You have got such lovely hair, I want
it. Now, if you hold still I won’t hurt you, but if you don’t
I will have to stick you.”</p>

<p>Mary’s eyes glared as she said this. Miss Williams was
very much frightened, but she sat perfectly still.</p>

<p>“If you will come home with me, Mary, I will give you
some hair I have that was cut off when I was sick.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I want this hair,” replied Mary, stubbornly.
“Oh, how pretty it will look on the doll!” she cried.</p>

<p>Bob made up his mind that it was time for him to act.
He saw that the witless woman would either cut off Miss
Williams’ hair, or hurt her with the scissors.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky I’m here,” thought Bob, “even if I was kept
in for nothing.”</p>

<p>Bob stooped low in the shadow of the desks, and crept
down the aisle. As he got clear of the last desk, Mary
pulled back the head of the teacher. Miss Williams uttered
a faint scream.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hurt you, but you must keep still,” cried
Mary, quite angrily.</p>

<p>Bob reached her side in a quick dash. He reached out
so strongly that he managed to wrench the scissors from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hand. Giving them a fling away over beyond the last row
of desks, Bob got a firm grip on Mary’s wrist.</p>

<p>Miss Williams saw what he had done and gave a glad
cry.</p>

<p>She at once seized the other wrist of Mary. Then both
held her a prisoner.</p>

<p>Mary got very wild. She turned on Bob and her eyes
were blazing.</p>

<p>“You bad boy!” she cried. “When I get my scissors again
I’ll cut your fingers off.”</p>

<p>“Now be sensible, Mary,” pleaded Miss Williams gently
with the struggling woman. “You don’t want me to send for
the constable and have you taken back to the poor farm, do
you?”</p>

<p>This terrified and finally quieted the mad woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” she cried. “Please don’t do that; please
don’t!”</p>

<p>“See here, Mary,” said Bob, “you know my mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Bob,” answered the woman, nodding.</p>

<p>“She’s your friend, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! She gave me a week’s work and a nice
room all to myself last spring.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come with me, Mary,” said Bob, “and we’ll
go up to the house. My mother has been making a silk quilt,
and I’m sure she has some pretty pieces she’ll give you to
fix up your doll.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t that be fine!” cried Mary, in childish glee.
“Yes, yes,” she said; “take me there right away, will you?”</p>

<p>They felt safe now to let go of Mary. She clapped her
hands in great glee, and seemed to have forgotten about
cutting off the teacher’s hair.</p>

<p>“Mary,” asked Miss Williams, “have you been hiding in
the storeroom ever since school began?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ma’am, and long before that”</p>

<p>“Did you tip over a bottle of ink in there?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to, but I did,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind; it was an accident. I am very sorry,
Bob, I suspected you of hiding the truth, and kept you in.”</p>

<p>“It’s good you did, the way things have turned out, isn’t
it now, Miss Williams?” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“I shall tell the scholars that I was in the wrong,” said
the teacher.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re never much in the wrong,” said Bob, gallantly.
“All the fellows know you’re always fair and good to us.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Come on. Let us run,” spoke Mary, and Bob let her
take his hand. “Remember, now, I’m to have some of those
fine silk patches?”</p>

<p>“I am sure my mother will give them to you, Mary,”
replied Bob.</p>

<p>Some of the Burr crowd hooted and jeered as they saw
Bob with Simple Mary. Sammy ran after him, and Bob
explained matters to his chum.</p>

<p>“Be sure to get back here by one o’clock, Bob,” called out
Sammy, as they parted.</p>

<p>“Is there going to be a game?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, a fine one, and our crowd needs you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be on hand,” promised Bob.</p>

<p>Mary chatted in her childish, innocent way. When they
reached the Bouncer home Mary sat down on the grass to pet
a little kitten. This gave Bob a chance to get to his mother
and explain how matters were.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bouncer came out, in her pleasant, kindly way, and
took Mary into the house. Bob knew that his mother would
do all that was right for the poor lady, and set about his
noon-time chores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>He had his lunch and then went up to his den to get some
of his football togs. When he came down his mother told
him that the village sewing circle was to meet at the house
that afternoon. They would arrange for the comfort and
safety of Mary in some way, she said.</p>

<p>As Bob started from the house he saw Mary seated in the
little summer-house, looking over some pretty pieces of silk
like a pleased child, and singing to herself in a happy, contented
way.</p>

<p>“I’ve got lots of time,” said Bob to himself, as he walked
down the street, “but I’ll get to the field early, so as to have
a talk about the game with Dave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob! Bob!” called out a hurried voice, as he was
passing a neat little cottage, setting somewhat back from the
street.</p>

<p>Its owner and tenant, Miss Simmons, the prim old maid
of the village, came out to the gate. She looked worried.</p>

<p>“Bob, will you do me a favor?” she asked, in an excited
way.</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to, Miss Simmons,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, my little nephew Walter has been staying with me
for a few days. He has been missing for over an hour. I
thought he was playing with some neighbors’ children, but I
find that none of them has seen him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s safe somewhere,” said Bob, seeing how nervous
and frightened the old maid was.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please try and find him?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” replied Bob, promptly. “I’ll look
myself, and if I don’t find him I’ll get the other boys to join
in the search.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you,” said Miss Simmons.</p>

<p>Bob turned around to start down the street, when he
chanced to look ahead of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Miss Simmons, there is Walter now,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, so it is,” cried the old maid, starting down the
street.</p>

<p>A dusty, tired-out little youngster came towards them.
Bob walked on with Miss Simmons, until they reached him.</p>

<p>“You bad little boy!” cried Miss Simmons, seizing Walter
by the arms. “Where have you ever been?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been playing postman, that’s all,” replied the little
fellow.</p>

<p>He perked up in a proud sort of a way as he said this,
Bob thought.</p>

<p>“Postman?” repeated Miss Simmons, with a sniff.</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunty.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve been giving out letters all along the street,
’way, ’way down it,” replied the little urchin, with a slow,
long sweep of his chubby little arm.</p>

<p>“What letters? Where did you get them?” asked Miss
Simmons, sharply.</p>

<p>“Just out of the box on your bureau, Aunty,” was the
innocent reply.</p>

<p>“Out of&mdash;my box&mdash;on&mdash;the bureau!” almost shrieked
Miss Simmons, turning pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunty.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do with them?” cried Miss Simmons,
greatly excited.</p>

<p>“I passed them out, just as our postman does, to all the
houses.”</p>

<p>“O-oh! o-oh!” screamed the old maid.</p>

<p>Then she fell against the fence as if overcome, and slipped
to the ground. She wrung her hands, and screamed outright.
The amazed Bob saw her roll over on the grass in a fit of
hysterics.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="pch">THE LOST LETTERS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> hardly knew what hysterics were. He thought that
Miss Simmons was in a fit.</p>

<p>“Don’t get scared, Walter,” he said to the little boy, who
was frightened and began to cry.</p>

<p>Bob jumped over the fence and ran to the pump in the
yard. A cup hung on a nail. He filled this with cool, fresh
water, and ran back to Miss Simmons. She was sitting up
by this time and moaning, but she saw him coming.</p>

<p>“Don’t throw that water on me,” she said. “I’m only
faint. Let me drink. Oh, those letters! those letters!”</p>

<p>Miss Simmons got to her feet, and at once fell against the
fence again. Bob wondered why she was so stirred up.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t get so excited if I were you,” he said. “What
about the letters, Miss Simmons?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t tell. That is&mdash;they are very precious&mdash;I
mean important,” stammered the old maid, covering her face
with her hands.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can get them back for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could you? Can you?” cried the woman, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I can try,” said Bob. “Were there many of them?”</p>

<p>“Just twenty, Bob,” replied Miss Simmons.</p>

<p>“Twenty? Were they all addressed to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, years ago. Oh, I must get them back at once, Bob&mdash;at
once,” and she acted as if she was going into another
fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe people will bring them back to you,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“But they would read them first. Oh, I should die if
they did! I would leave town. Everybody would be laughing
at me.”</p>

<p>“What would they laugh for?” asked honest Bob.</p>

<p>Miss Simmons did not reply to this. She only wrung her
hands and looked worried to death.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob, please try and get those letters back,” she
begged of him. “I’ll pay you well.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any pay,” said Bob. “Here, Walter, you
come with me and show me what you did with those letters.”</p>

<p>Bob caught hold of Walter’s hands, but the little fellow
hung back.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go,” he whimpered.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m all tired out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll carry you on my back part of the way,” promised
Bob, “and I’ll make you a fine kite next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! I’ll go, I’ll go,” cried Walter.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Simmons, you go in the house and get some
rest and quiet,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can get the letters back?” asked Miss
Simmons, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry now,” said Bob. “I’m going to do the best
I can, and, you see, I stand a good show, getting after them
so quickly.”</p>

<p>Miss Simmons went into the house, and Bob hoisted
Walter to his back.</p>

<p>“Now then,” he said, “you must tell me just what you did
with those letters.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” replied the little fellow, greatly delighted
at the ride and the promise of a kite. “You see, I went down
this street to the next corner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Bob.</p>

<p>“Then I turned and went down one side of the next street
and back the other.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with the letters?”</p>

<p>“I went up on the stoops, just like the postman, and left
a letter on each step.”</p>

<p>“Did you knock or ring the bell?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“Why not? The postman does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” said little Walter, “but I did it as a
s’prise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a surprise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, s’prise. That’s the first house,” said Walter, pointing
around the corner as they reached the next street.</p>

<p>Bob lowered Walter to a hitching-block, and went up the
walk leading to the house before which he had halted.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” he said to himself, as he saw the end of
an old envelope sticking out from half-way under the door.</p>

<p>“One of the twenty letters, anyway,” added Bob, placing
the envelope in his pocket, as he read the address of Miss
Simmons upon it.</p>

<p>At the second house he saw no letter lying around the
porch. A lady came to the door. She knew Bob.</p>

<p>“I am looking for a letter Miss Simmons’ little nephew
left on your door-step,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I saw him come in, and I thought it was a
circular. Then I noticed Miss Simmons’ name on it, and
guessed the little fellow was up to some boyish prank. Here
it is. I was going to return it to her.”</p>

<p>Thus Bob went down one side of the street. At every
place but one he found the letters where they had been left.
At the one place a boy had found the letter, and carried it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as far as the street, and threw it into the grass, where Bob now
found it.</p>

<p>By the time Bob had gone up the other side of the street
nearly to its end, he had gathered up sixteen of the lost letters.
There was only one house left. It was a big residence. A
rich family named Dunbar lived there. Bob knew they were
still absent at some summer resort.</p>

<p>“Did you leave any of the letters here, Walter?” he asked
of his little charge.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, all of the rest of them.”</p>

<p>“How many?”</p>

<p>“Three&mdash;no, four, I guess,” replied Walter. “You see, it’s
a big house, and I thought a good many people would live
in it.”</p>

<p>“Where did you put the letters?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I threw them right up on the porch.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see them,” said Bob.</p>

<p>The porch was sheltered by vines. Bob walked around
the yard. He knew that no one occupied the house just now.
There was quite a breeze, and he thought that maybe the
wind had blown the letters out into the garden.</p>

<p>Bob looked all about the lot. It slanted at the rear to
a little creek. He noticed papers and leaves all along this,
but he did not come across the missing letters.</p>

<p>“They must have blown away,” he said to himself,
“unless they’re on the other end of the porch. I’ll look
there.”</p>

<p>Bob went up to the steps. He paused, a little surprised,
as he noticed, stretched out on a rustic settee in its shade, a
shabbily-dressed man he had never seen in Fairview before.</p>

<p>“Hello, mister,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, lad,” replied the man, getting up and looking
Bob over in a sharp, quick way. “Belong here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Neither do I. You see, I am tramping it through town.
Sort of hot and dusty. Nobody living here, so I thought no
one would grudge me a trifle of rest.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Bob, glancing all about the porch.</p>

<p>“Looking for something, lad?” asked the tramp, noticing
this.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I was,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Some letters. That little boy out at the gate got hold
of some letters of his aunt, Miss Simmons. She lives down
the street. He played postman, and left them at a lot of
houses.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the man, slowly, as if thinking hard, “that’s it,
eh? Valuable letters?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t suppose so,” replied Bob. “They were
old letters that Miss Simmons had kept for a good many
years. She is dreadfully upset about losing them.”</p>

<p>“Say,” grinned the man, “I’ll bet they’re old love-letters.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” replied Bob. “Anyhow, there were twenty of
them.”</p>

<p>“Twenty?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you find any of them?”</p>

<p>“All except four,” replied Bob. “Little Walter says he
left those on this porch here. You didn’t see them, did you,
mister?”</p>

<p>“Me? No,” said the man, in a sort of a shifty way.</p>

<p>“I thought you might, having been here probably when
the little fellow left them.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was snoozing,” declared the man. “Where do you
suppose they went to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think they have blown away among the litter down by
the creek,” explained Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, that seems likely,” said the man.</p>

<p>He slouched down the steps and loitered about the gate
as Bob took little Walter away towards the home of Miss
Simmons. As he turned into her yard he happened to glance
back. The man he had just left stood in the middle of the
sidewalk, watching where he went.</p>

<p>“Did you find them&mdash;oh, did you find them?” asked Miss
Simmons, anxiously, as Bob came up the steps.</p>

<p>“Most of them, Miss Simmons,” replied Bob, handing
her sixteen of the letters.</p>

<p>“There are four of them missing,” said the old maid,
counting the letters.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. I know where Walter left them, though.”</p>

<p>“Where, Bob?”</p>

<p>“At the Dunbar house.”</p>

<p>“There is no one at home there now.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but the letters were gone. Tell you, Miss
Simmons, I feel pretty sure the wind blew them across the
yard and in among a great lot of litter near the creek.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so! Oh, I hope no one will ever find them!”
sighed Miss Simmons. “I haven’t got any change in the
house, Bob, but when you come by again stop in, and I’ll
give you ten cents.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it,” replied Bob. “When I have time,
Miss Simmons, I’ll make another search for those four
missing letters.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good boy, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Simmons.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and, Bob, please don’t tell anybody I took on so
about those letters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, ma’am, I won’t,” promised Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>He went on his way, whistling. The man he had met at
the Dunbar house had gotten out of sight by this time. Bob
supposed he was some tramp passing through the village. He
forgot all about him, and Miss Simmons, too, as he hurried
towards the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>There was a fine meadow right near the school grounds.
This had been chosen as a favorite spot for sport. The
baseball and football teams of the town played there regularly.
It was marked off for both games, and there were
some benches at one corner of the field. At the other end
there was a tennis court.</p>

<p>“Those letters have made me late,” said Bob to himself,
as he passed the schoolhouse and saw the crowd of boys
already gathered on the field.</p>

<p>Dave Duncan was just telling off the school teams for
football. There was some squabbling, as usual, on the part
of Jed Burr.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to play till my right tackle comes,” he
declared.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t wait for that,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to. You ain’t running my crowd.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” said Dave, “but if you make me the
manager I’ve got to have some say, haven’t I? We’ll only
practise this afternoon, and get in trim for the real game
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“All right,” grumbled Jed.</p>

<p>There was a merry boyish scramble as the game began.
Not much attention was paid to the rules, and that made it
better than ever. Bob was quick and active.</p>

<p>The boys had been playing for about twenty minutes,
when a kick past goal meant three hand-running for his
side. He had got the football, and was in position for a
splendid play, when he saw Jed making for him to spoil it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“No fair!” shouted Sammy, Bob and some others.</p>

<p>Jed paid no attention to this. He ran forward all the
faster. This made Bob hurry. He gave the ball a wild
kick.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Ya-ah! three times and out!”</p>

<p>Bob, with a good deal of pleasure, watched the leather
sphere swing past Jed. Then, with a little start, he stared
hard as it landed.</p>

<p>A weazened old man was making a short cut across the
end of the field. The ball landed directly against his
stomach.</p>

<p>It must have been going with some force, for at once the
man doubled up like a jack-knife.</p>

<p>He fell flat to the ground, his hat flying in one direction
and his cane in another. Sammy ran up to Bob with a look
of dismay on his face.</p>

<p>“I say, Bob,” he spoke hurriedly, “we’re in for it now&mdash;it’s
old Silas Dolby!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="pch">SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY</span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> mischief!” cried Frank, as he joined Bob and
Sammy.</p>

<p>Jed Burr and his crowd thought it was funny to see the
old man flounder around.</p>

<p>“Buffer!” cried one of them.</p>

<p>“Hey, want a back-stop?” echoed another.</p>

<p>“He’s smashed something,” spoke a third.</p>

<p>“Seems to be his watch,” reported the first speaker.</p>

<p>“You’re in a fix, Bob, this time, sure,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it’s Mr. Dolby,” replied Bob. “He doesn’t
like any of us any too well.”</p>

<p>Silas Dolby was a miserly old man who had few friends
in Fairview, and he was tight-fisted, cross, and too shrewd
to please honest people.</p>

<p>Bob, Frank and Sammy were “down in his bad books,”
as the saying goes. It was none of their fault, but rather a
merit. While camping in the mountains on Sammy Brown’s
treasure search, they had found a pocketbook.</p>

<p>This they gave to Frank’s father, who looked it over. It
belonged to Silas Dolby, who had lost it, and was full of
papers. Among them Mr. Haven found some notes that
should have been given to a poor widow in the village, the
mother of little, crippled Benny Lane. It seemed that
her husband had paid money on a mortgage on their little
home to old Dolby. After Mr. Lane died the miser said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
nothing about this. He was going to turn Mrs. Lane out
of her house. When Mr. Haven told of the hidden notes,
they made old Silas Dolby turn the house over to its rightful
owner. This made Mrs. Lane a happy woman, but after
that Mr. Dolby snarled and glared at the boys whenever he
came near them.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Bob, I’ll try and explain to Mr. Dolby,” said
Frank, as Bob started towards the prostrate man.</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to face the music myself,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>The other boys had run forward to where the old miser
was just getting to his feet. His face was wrathy, and he
scowled at the crowd.</p>

<p>“Here is your cane, Mr. Dolby,” said Frank, picking up
the stick and offering it to its owner.</p>

<p>“And here’s your hat,” added Sammy.</p>

<p>“Who threw that ball at me?” roared the old miser.</p>

<p>“Bob Bouncer kicked it,” said Jed Burr.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was you, was it?” snarled the angry old man,
making a lunge with his cane. Bob stood his ground.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Dolby,” replied Bob, “but it was an accident.”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know anybody was crossing the field.”</p>

<p>“Bosh! That ball has lamed my chest. I don’t know but
what I’m hurt inside.”</p>

<p>“Let us help you home, Mr. Dolby,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Get away!” shouted the old man, not much like a person
very seriously injured. “See here, Bob Bouncer, I know
your mean feelings towards me.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Bah! Well, whether you have or not, who’s going to
pay for that?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dolby pointed down to the spot where he had fallen.
A half-sunken stone marked a base. In falling, it seemed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his watch had spilled out of his pocket. It had landed on
the stone. There it lay, its case open and bent, and its glass
face smashed in.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, I declare!” spoke Frank. “Mr. Dolby,
we’re awfully sorry you broke your watch.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t break it,” snarled the perverse old man. “You
fellows smashed it&mdash;Bob Bouncer did. Think it smart, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” answered Bob, “for I didn’t mean to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll make you smart for it, never fear.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the watch isn’t much hurt,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“Hurt? It’s ruined!” cried old Dolby. “A valuable old
timepiece, too. Why, I wouldn’t lose that watch for one
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“See here, Mr. Dolby,” spoke Frank, somewhat angry at
the way the old man talked, “we’ll get the watch fixed for
you.”</p>

<p>“Huh! you’ll have to.”</p>

<p>“My father has bought out the Jones jewelry store, and
put my uncle in charge. I’ll tell him about the watch, and
if you’ll give it to me he’ll mend it for you.”</p>

<p>“Give it to you and never see it again?” sneered the old
man. “Not much.”</p>

<p>“Then fetch it down to the store, and my uncle will fix
it.”</p>

<p>Silas Dolby did not say much after this. He took up
the watch, shook his cane at the boys, and went away
grumbling to himself.</p>

<p>“I hope that watch won’t cost much,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a dollar towards fixing it,” said Frank.
“The money the chauffeur gave us, you know.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all pitch in and work out the rest of it,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Sammy, cheerfully, for he saw that Bob was rather glum
over his bad luck.</p>

<p>The accident quite dampened their spirits, and they did
not take much more interest in the game.</p>

<p>About three o’clock, as they were leaving the field, Dave
Duncan came up to them.</p>

<p>“Hi, you fellows,” he sang out in his usual lively fashion,
“our crowd is in for a picnic to-night.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re to meet at the Cove at seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“A boating party, eh?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“No, we call it a clam bake, but, of course, there won’t
be many clams. We’ll have a big bonfire, and some of the
fellows are going to bring a lunch.”</p>

<p>“Jolly,” said Sammy. “I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Count me in, Dave,” said Frank.</p>

<p>He and Bob and Sammy started homewards. They were
all thinking of the broken watch.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go around to the store and tell my uncle
about that watch,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll go, too,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go home for a bit,” said Bob. “But I’ll come
around to your house in about half an hour.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Bob went home. His mother at noon had asked him to
call some time during the afternoon, to take a note to a lady
living some distance from them. Bob got the note and
delivered it. Then he started on his way to look for his
chums.</p>

<p>As he came to the street where Miss Simmons lived, Bob
continued down it.</p>

<p>“It’s only a block out of my way,” he said. “Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
something new has turned up about those letters. I’m curious
to know.”</p>

<p>Just as Bob got near the Simmons place, he paused and
drew back in the shelter of a big oak tree.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” he could not help saying, and he peered
curiously at the gateway of the place. A man was just passing
through it.</p>

<p>The lad stood stock still and stared as he saw that this
man was the tramp he had caught lounging about the Dunbar
place. The fellow was too much taken up with what he
was about to notice Bob. Besides, he started from the gate
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>As he did so, Bob noticed that he was looking over some
money in his hand. Bob caught sight of a green bank note,
and heard some loose silver jingled. The man thrust this
money into his pocket, and folded up a piece of paper that
made Bob think of a note or a check.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand that at all,” spoke out Bob. “And I
don’t like it at all,” he added, after a moment’s thought. “I
guess I’ll see Miss Simmons.”</p>

<p>Bob entered the yard. As he came up the steps of the
porch he heard some one sobbing. Looking towards the
other end of the porch he made out Miss Simmons.</p>

<p>She was seated in a porch rocker and looked very wretched.
As she saw Bob she tried to hide her tears.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter, Miss Simmons?” asked the lad
in a kindly way.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” replied the old maid. “You see, I have had
a very trying afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Bob. “Miss Simmons, I just saw a
man leave here. He’s a stranger in Fairview, I think.”</p>

<p>Miss Simmons looked quite startled at this. She flushed
a little and clasped her hands nervously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, Bob, I guess he is,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Was he begging? I think he is a tramp.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” nodded the old maid, quickly.</p>

<p>“I thought I would stop in as I was going by,” said Bob.
“I’ll try and get time to look again for those four missing
letters this afternoon, Miss Simmons.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you needn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because they have been found,” said Miss Simmons.
“See, I have them all now,” and she drew aside her apron to
show a package in her lap.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m awful glad you got them back,” said Bob.</p>

<p>He was very much surprised, but Miss Simmons did not
explain any further.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go,” he said, moving down the steps. “If I
can help you in any way, Miss Simmons, please tell me.”</p>

<p>“No, Bob,” replied the old maid, “there is nothing you
can do. I am greatly obliged for what you have done. I’ll
have a little change for you when I see you again.”</p>

<p>Bob went away slowly. He did not at all like the looks
of things.</p>

<p>“Sort of funny,” he thought. “She has got those letters
back, she says. How did she get them? I’ll bet I know.
That tramp found them.”</p>

<p>Bob walked along, figuring out his own ideas.</p>

<p>“I feel pretty sure that tramp told me a story,” he said to
himself. “I was goose enough to tell him about the letters
and Miss Simmons. He had the letters all the time he was
pumping me on the porch of the Dunbar place. Then he
came to Miss Simmons and made the poor woman pay a lot
for them. How much, I wonder? I hope she wasn’t foolish
enough to let the fellow rob her.”</p>

<p>Bob had promised Miss Simmons that he would say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
nothing about the letters. A few minutes later he saw Frank
and Sammy coming down the street.</p>

<p>“I wish I could tell them about Miss Simmons, and see
what they think about it,” he mused. “I can’t do it, though,
and keep my word. Hello, fellows, which way?” he hailed,
as he came up to his chums.</p>

<p>“We’re going up to Mr. Dolby’s,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“My uncle told me to go up there and get that watch,”
explained Frank.</p>

<p>“To have it mended?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he says he’ll do it for nothing for us.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” cried Bob. “Come on, I’ll go with you.
What’s that, Frank?” he asked, as he saw his friend put a key
from his hand into his coat pocket.</p>

<p>“It’s an extra key to the jewelry store.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to carry one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied Frank, with a laugh. “My uncle got
it made, and I’m to take it to my father, so if he ever wants
to get into the store when uncle is away he can do so.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“Father has put a lot of money into the business,” went on
Frank.</p>

<p>“So I heard.”</p>

<p>“You see, uncle is a watchmaker, and both thought it
would be a good thing to buy out the old jeweler, Jones,
who wanted to move to the city.”</p>

<p>The boys reached the Dolby house to find it shut up tight
and as dismal looking as ever. Frank went up the walk,
while his comrades waited at the gate.</p>

<p>Just as he went up the steps there was a rush and a growl,
and a savage dog came running up to Frank.</p>

<p>Every boy in Fairview was afraid of the old miser’s dog.
A good many had pelted him as they went by the place, and
that made him ugly. Silas Dolby, it was said, half starved
the poor animal, and that made him fierce.</p>

<p>“Get back! Go away!” called Frank, backing away from
the dog.</p>

<p>The animal growled and sprang and snapped at him.
Frank stumbled over a broken board. Then he picked up a
crotched piece of tree wood. The dog fought him half way
back to the gate, when Bob and Sammy came running up
to the rescue of their chum. The dog had caught and torn
Frank’s sleeve. They beat him off with switches, but the
animal was vicious and stubborn, and followed them up.</p>

<p>Just as they got through the gate and slammed it shut, Mr.
Dolby appeared on the steps.</p>

<p>“Hi, there; what are you up to?” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I had a message for you, but your dog wouldn’t let me
in,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“What’s your message?” asked the old man, surlily.</p>

<p>“My uncle says he will fix up your watch for you as good
as new.”</p>

<p>“Who pays for it?”</p>

<p>“We have arranged for that.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take it down to him this evening.”</p>

<p>Sammy was brushing the dirt from Frank’s clothing while
this talk was going on.</p>

<p>“I’m a good deal mussed up,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“We won’t go into that yard again in a hurry,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Frank was smoothing down his coat. He happened to
feel in his pockets to see if everything was safe.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried, suddenly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“The key.”</p>

<p>“What about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s gone! You saw me put it in my pocket on our way
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It must have fallen out of my pocket over in the yard
there.”</p>

<p>“Think so? Oh, say, Mr. Dolby!” called out Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked the old man, who was just going
back into the house.</p>

<p>“I wish you would chain up that dog of yours for a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Frank has lost a key in your yard, and he wants to find
it.”</p>

<p>“Key to what?” growled old Dolby.</p>

<p>“To my father’s jewelry store,” explained Frank.</p>

<p>“What were you doing with it?”</p>

<p>“My uncle asked me to take it up to the house.”</p>

<p>“Huh! You’re making a great lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dolby picked up a heavy club off the porch and
started after the dog. When the animal dodged his blows he
flung the club at him, striking him on the ribs. The dog
howled with pain, slunk into his kennel, and then his master
chained him up.</p>

<p>The boys now came into the yard. They looked and
groped all over the garden where Frank had backed away
from the dog. Silas Dolby stood watching them.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” at length spoke Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve gone over the ground pretty well,” said
Sammy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I lost the key before I came here,” added Frank.
“Thank you, Mr. Dolby.”</p>

<p>The old miser only grunted and scowled. The boys
started for home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>As they came to the next corner Bob chanced to look
back. He hung behind his chatting companions for a moment
or two.</p>

<p>“That’s queer again,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>He had seen a man turn into the Dolby place. It was only
a glimpse he had of the fellow, but Bob was quite startled.</p>

<p>“Hey, what are you lagging behind for?” called out
Sammy, briskly.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” mused Bob, “I’ve got my head so full of that
tramp, I take every stranger I see for him. It couldn’t have
been him I just saw go into Dolby’s. And if it was, what of
it?”</p>

<p>With that Bob let the subject drift out of his mind. He
joined his chums, who were gaily talking over their plans
for the big bonfire on the beach of Rainbow Lake that night.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="pch">THE BIG BONFIRE</span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Bob</span>, isn’t this fine?” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Jolly!” replied Bob, with vim.</p>

<p>“And the eating&mdash;um! um!” gloated Sammy, nibbling at
a toasted piece of cheese on the end of a stick.</p>

<p>The big bonfire was in progress, and it was a great success.
During the afternoon Dave Duncan and some friends had
gathered up all the driftwood along the beach of Rainbow
Lake for half a mile. It was now blazing cheerily.</p>

<p>Others of the crowd had brought the eatables. A farmer’s
boy had donated a quarter of a cheese. Another had brought
a whole ham, home-smoked. The baker’s boy had come on
the scene with a box of crackers and some doughnuts.</p>

<p>It was a regular toasting bee. The great fire cast a cheery
glow out over the beautiful blue waters of the lake. It lit
up a group of lively, happy faces, The crowd roasted potatoes,
ham, crackers and cheese. Forks made out of branches were
used as toasters, and the novelty and variety gave the boys
wonderful appetites.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Ben Travers and Dick Hazelton are missing
this,” said Dave, sprinkling some salt into a luscious, roasted
potato.</p>

<p>“Yes, they promised to come,” spoke Sammy.</p>

<p>“Here they are, now!” cried Bob, as two welcome figures
came into the glow of the campfire.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted half a dozen jubilant voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick carried over his shoulder a great big corn popper,
and Ben a bag.</p>

<p>“Had to do some running around to gather up half a
bushel of prime pop corn,” reported Ben.</p>

<p>Soon there was the swish-swish! of the hard kernels in
the popper. Then&mdash;pop-pop-pop! Eager eyes watched the
little snow white mountain in the popper grow and try to
burst its cage.</p>

<p>“Here you are, fellows!” sang out Ben, emptying several
quarts of the popped corn on the spread-out bag he had
brought along.</p>

<p>Ben had a can of salt, and each one fixed the corn to his
liking. Very soon all hands had eaten their fill and were
bubbling over with excitement and fun.</p>

<p>Five mischief-makers, including Bob and Sammy, dubbed
themselves a “Committee” to get up a programme. They
went aside a little to make their plans. There were some
suspicious and mysterious whisperings. Three of the crowd
disappeared in the shadows down the beach.</p>

<p>“Now then, fellows,” sang out Dave, mounting a rock, as
if it was a throne, “attention and order.”</p>

<p>“Set the ball rolling,” drawled out lazy Tim Barker, who
had eaten so much that he lay flat on the sand.</p>

<p>“Speech! speech!” called out Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s good,” said Dave. “Let’s see&mdash;whom shall we
select?”</p>

<p>“Why, Clarence Brooks here is the orator of the school,
isn’t he?” said Sammy, winking.</p>

<p>Clarence was a fussy little fellow whose father was a
public lecturer. He was always ready to speak a piece.</p>

<p>“Give us ‘The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck,’ Clarence,”
suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too old,” sang out Tim Barker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s why he knows it so well,” chuckled Dick Hazelton.</p>

<p>“All right,” bowed Clarence, putting one hand behind
him, as he had seen his father do on the lecture platform.
“‘The boy&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Bob. “You’ve got to have a ‘deck’ to
stand on.”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Sammy, “this is just the thing for it.”</p>

<p>An anchor log floated right near to the beach. It was
pretty steady, and after some wobbling Clarence got a foot-hold
on it.</p>

<p>“‘The boy stood on the burning deck&mdash;&mdash;’” he began.</p>

<p>Flop!</p>

<p>Splash!</p>

<p>Mischief lovers hiding behind a near rock had given a
rope tied to the log a sudden jerk. Clarence took a dive.</p>

<p>His mouth was so full of water and sand, as they fished
him out, that he could not say much. He acted pretty
grumpy, until the next thing on the programme made him
laugh with the others, and forget his own troubles.</p>

<p>“A song!” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>Everybody looked at Dudley Norton. He always sang at
the school exhibitions.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dud,” called out Dave. “There’s no piano
here, but ‘What Are the Wild Waves Saying’ will sound real
cute.”</p>

<p>Dudley had a fairly good voice. He got the first line
out all right. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ba-a!</p>

<p>Me-aiow!</p>

<p>Honk-honk-honk!</p>

<p>To-whit! to-whoo!</p>

<p>Catcalls, hootings, imitations of all kinds of animals rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
out from a dozen spots among the shrubbery of the bluff side,
where one-half of the crowd had secretly placed themselves.
At the end of every line they had some new hoots and calls.</p>

<p>A hideous babel rang out at the end of the song.</p>

<p>Dudley, however, stuck manfully to his task. As he
sounded the last note something whizzed through the air. It
was then that Clarence laughed.</p>

<p>Some flying missile came whirling towards the bonfire.
Then another, and another. The first one landed directly in
the open mouth of the singer.</p>

<p>Swish-chug-splatter!</p>

<p>Dudley seemed to swallow the last note of the song. The
second missile landed on the nose of the “chairman” of the
crowd, Dave. The surprise and the force sent him backwards,
and he landed flat on his back on the sand.</p>

<p>“Yah-yahoo! Bob! bing! boo! Biggity-baggity, Blue!
Blue! Blue!”</p>

<p>This was the war-cry adopted by “The Blues,” as the Burr
crowd had dubbed themselves. A regular shower of missiles
began to rain down from the top of the bluff.</p>

<p>“Tomatoes!” gurgled Dave, rubbing his face.</p>

<p>“And ripe ones, too!” added Clarence, with a grimace.</p>

<p>“Give them the chase!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“No, they’ll round on us and spoil our campfire,” said
Dave.</p>

<p>The triumphant cries of “The Blues” died away in the
distance. Then Dave suggested a game.</p>

<p>The crowd was divided. A space about twenty feet either
side of the fire was marked with stakes. It was a sort of
“Hunt the Gray,” only that one side was given time to disappear
in the darkness. They could hide along the beach, or
in among the shrubbery of the bluff side, as they chose.</p>

<p>Six of the party held “the fort,” as the staked-off space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was called, three at either end. The other six were called
“scouts.” They were sent out to rout out and capture “the
enemy.” Any of the latter who got into the fort without being
tagged, became a “ranger” for the next game as well.</p>

<p>Every once in a while it was the rule that a ranger
should give out a signal shout, so as to direct the scouts in
the direction of his hiding place.</p>

<p>Bob kept with his fellow rangers until they scattered to
different points along the bluff side. Then he tried a scheme
of getting into the fort on his own hook.</p>

<p>There was not a foot on the bluff that Bob did not know
by heart. He aimed to reach a point where a sharp descent
led right down to the campfire. If he could get on a line
between the stakes, and could run, tumble or slide fast
enough, he counted on landing in the fort before any one
could reach and tag him.</p>

<p>Edging along in among the shrubbery, Bob finally reached
the bare spot in the shelving bluff where he was to try his
dash for the fort.</p>

<p>“I guess the way is clear,” he said to himself, peering
around the edge of a nest of shrubbery on a shelf of rocks.</p>

<p>Then Bob was a good deal surprised to catch the sound
of voices. At first he thought it was some of the Burr crowd
lying in ambush, and pricked up his ears sharply.</p>

<p>As he listened, Bob traced the voices right beyond him.
They were men’s voices. By stooping and peering through
a network of vines, Bob made out two men lying on the
ground. There was light enough from the campfire to show
that they had made a bed of leaves and branches, and that one
of them had a green patch over one eye.</p>

<p>“I know the other man,” said Bob to himself. “He is the
tramp I met to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob was very sure of this as he heard the voice of the
man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he was saying, “I’ve picked up some money in the
town.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t we go to some hotel and be comfortable?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with this soft bed in such fine
weather? Has a haystack got too common for you?”</p>

<p>“No, but if you’ve got money, let’s enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“H’m! See here, we’re partners, but I’m the boss.”</p>

<p>“You act it, sure,” grumbled the man with the green patch
over his eye.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some money,” went on the tramp, “but we’re
going to get so much more, that this little bit isn’t worth
thinking of.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. We’re coming back here soon to rob a place
where we’ll get a whole fortune.”</p>

<p>“What place?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, now. Why I want to stay here till we
leave town early in the morning, is because I don’t want to
be seen around here, so that when we come back again we
won’t be known&mdash;see?”</p>

<p>“I declare!” breathed Bob to himself. “These men are
thieves! I wonder who they’re going to rob?”</p>

<p>Bob became quite excited over what he had heard. It
startled him to run across the tramp so many times in one
day. He had had a poor opinion of the man all along. Now
it was worse than ever. Bob fidgeted around, hardly knowing
what to do next, when something happened.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="pch">BOMBARDED</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> heard some object come rolling and ripping its way
along from the top of the bluff. It mowed down grass,
snapped off bushes, and, striking a rock, bounded up like a
rubber ball.</p>

<p>“It’s a pumpkin,” said Bob. “Here she comes! Crackey!”</p>

<p>The pumpkin cut through the vines that sheltered the
tramp and his friend. The man with the green patch over
one eye seemed to have heard it coming.</p>

<p>He half arose, and just then the great yellow sphere
struck him. He went flat as a pancake. The pumpkin rolled
over him, struck a tree, and was smashed into a thousand
pieces.</p>

<p>“Uh! what’s this now?” spluttered the tramp, as pieces
of rind, seeds and fiber rained over his body and face.</p>

<p>“Get out of this!” cried his companion.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tain’t safe.”</p>

<p>“It’s them boys. They’ve seen us, and are playing tricks
on us.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make ourselves scarce, then.”</p>

<p>Bob was about ready to laugh at the comical event of the
moment. Just then, however, he had all he could do to take
care of himself.</p>

<p>A second pumpkin came bounding down the bluff side. It
took Bob across the ankles, and swept him off his feet. He
was thrown headlong to the ground, doubled up like a ball.
The boy grabbed at a bush, missed it, and went rolling over
and over down the smooth incline.</p>

<p>There was a bare sheer descent for nearly thirty feet.
Along this Bob sped, and he could not stop himself. He
landed at the bottom of the slope, slid across the sand, and
came to a stop not ten feet away from the blazing fire.</p>

<p>“It’s raining pumpkins!” gasped Bob, sitting up and
staring around him.</p>

<p>All along the beach the yellow balls were bounding into
view. He saw the guards and the scouts skipping about to
get out of the range of the missiles. Fellows who had been
in hiding came dashing down to safe ground. Dave gave the
signal whistle for “All in.”</p>

<p>The boys gathered excitedly about their leader.</p>

<p>“See here, Dave,” cried Sammy, “this is the work of ‘The
Blues!’”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Let’s capture them,” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s pretty near time to go home, anyway,” agreed
Dave. “Keep together, fellows. If we catch any of them,
we’ll put them through a course of sprouts.”</p>

<p>“Hear them! hear them!” yelled Sammy.</p>

<p>Derisive cries floated down to the beach. This nettled
some of the boys. All of them were glad of a chance for
new fun and excitement.</p>

<p>“Divide, fellows,” ordered Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes, surround the enemy!” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>The two crowds scrambled up the bluff. Bob looked
about for some trace of the two men he had found in their
hide-out. They seemed to have gotten away from the spot.</p>

<p>The two parties got to the top of the bluff and ran
towards each other, hoping to capture the mischief makers
in a group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>They found a wagon which Jed and his friends had
dragged from some farm near by, loaded for the market. It
was only half filled with pumpkins. The rest of the load had
been used to bombard the boys on the beach.</p>

<p>“They’ve sneaked across the meadow yonder,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see some of them now,” cried Sammy, eagerly.
“See, they’re making for that grove yonder.”</p>

<p>There was a hot chase. Sammy had called to Bob and
Frank to join him. They and several others kept with
Sammy.</p>

<p>They reached the patch of timber and ran in and about
it. They hunted in the bushes and even up in some of the
trees, but got no sight or trace of the enemy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the well-known signal of the crowd rang out
over near some haystacks. The scattered group ran in the
direction of the call. They came upon Dave and six of his
fellows, who had formed a circle. In its center were two
panting, done-out boys of “The Blues.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got a couple of them,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Good!” echoed a chorus.</p>

<p>“Find some ropes, fellows,” ordered Dave.</p>

<p>Several boys ran towards a farm-yard near by. Bob
noticed that one of the captives was Jed Burr.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with us?” asked Jed.</p>

<p>“Douse him in the lake!” cried one urgent voice.</p>

<p>“No, roll him down the bluff,” said another.</p>

<p>“We’ll do better than that,” replied Dave. “Here, tie
their arms behind them,” he ordered, as several pieces of rope
were brought to him.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Jed. “Fun’s fun, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you spoiled ours just now, so we’re going to have
some fresh fun,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Jed tried to fight off his captors, but the crowd found it
easy to bind him and his companion.</p>

<p>“Lead them over into the timber,” said Dave.</p>

<p>This was done. In its loneliest part they halted. Ted
was tied with his back to a tree.</p>

<p>“Now you’ll have lots of time to think,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes, about pumpkins!”</p>

<p>“And tomatoes!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!”</p>

<p>They left Jed to his fate, kicking and scolding. The other
prisoner they took along with them. A little on their way,
they heard Jed whistling and yelling.</p>

<p>“Some of his friends will come and let him loose,” said
Dave.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with the other fellow?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll give him a walk.”</p>

<p>“Say, I’m due home,” said the captive.</p>

<p>“Not quite yet,” replied Dave. “You’ve got a long tramp
before you, sonny.”</p>

<p>“I only rolled one pumpkin.”</p>

<p>“That’s as bad as twenty-six.”</p>

<p>“And it smashed before it hit any one.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. We’ve got to make an example.”</p>

<p>“Jed’ll make you smart for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jed is smarting himself about this time,” chuckled
Sammy.</p>

<p>“March!” ordered the leader.</p>

<p>They made their prisoner dearly earn his liberty. He
had to escort the whole crowd home. As they dropped out
one by one, the unhappy captive had to keep right on with
the others. Some of the boys took the longest way home
they could think of, purposely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick Hazelton was the last one to reach home. He lived
about a mile north of the town. They had dragged the captive
around for nearly an hour at this time. As Bob was
bidding Dick good night, the prisoner sat down in the road
and began crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if it’s the baby act, let him off,” said Bob.</p>

<p>He was tired out himself after an active and exciting day.
When he got home, however, he did not forget to tell his
father about the two men he had heard talking in the hide-out
on the bluff.</p>

<p>Mr. Bouncer seemed to take the matter quite seriously.
Bob did not tell about Miss Simmons and the letters, nor
about thinking he saw the tramp at Silas Dolby’s house. He
only said that he had met the tramp several times during the
day, before he saw him with the man with the green shade
over his eye.</p>

<p>His father went at once to the telephone and called up
the village marshal. The next morning Bob learned that the
officer had not been able to find the two tramps. They had
probably left town.</p>

<p>Bob, Frank and Sammy the next day went over the route
they had taken when they went to the Dolby place. They
found the dog chained up, and even made a new search in
the miser’s yard, but they did not find the lost store key.</p>

<p>That day, too, the story of Simple Mary was told about
the school. Some Fairview ladies had gotten her a pleasant
place to work on a farm. Miss Williams explained in open
school about the broken ink bottle, and all Bob’s friends were
made happy to see him cleared from a false charge.</p>

<p>The wind-up of the big bonfire had made “The Blues”
and “The Grays” more at war than ever. About all it led to,
however, was closer rivalry in baseball and football games.</p>

<p>Things started in smoothly at school. The daily routine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of study had the usual fun mixed in with it. There was
nothing very new or exciting until the second Monday of the
term.</p>

<p>Then, just before school commenced, as Bob, Frank and
Sammy passed the house where Frank had stopped the runaway
automobile, Sammy pointed towards it.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried. “Some one has moved into that place
since Friday.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Frank, noticing some big empty boxes
on the porch, “and somebody is moving about there.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s the fat boy’s father?” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is,” said Sammy, as they walked on.</p>

<p>“Hi, hello! you fellows!” sounded a breathless voice, a
minute later.</p>

<p>Tom Chubb came running out of the gate of the place
the boys had just passed.</p>

<p>“Oh, moved into town, have you?” asked Frank, shaking
the hand of the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad of it,” said Bob. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m going with you,” was the reply. “My father saw
the teacher last evening, and I’m to start at school this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Sammy, waving his cap in the air.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="pch">THE SPELLING CONTEST</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom Chubb</span> was smiling all over his face at getting such
a warm welcome from Bob and his friends.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” he spoke, “I don’t pretend to know much,
but I stick to a chum.”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>“There’s a fellow you don’t want to let stick to you,” spoke
Bob.</p>

<p>He pointed to Jed Burr, who was up to his usual trick
of meddling with the affairs of others. Two little fellows
were tossing a croquet ball to each other. Jed stood about
half way between them, jumping up in the air, and trying to
stop the ball.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t like his looks one bit,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Jed looked at Tom. He always had fun, as he called it,
with green scholars. He made no move towards Tom, however,
for he thought that Bob and the others had warned the
fat boy against him. Besides that, Tom did not look as if he
would mind one of Jed’s smart slaps on the back any more
than he would a fly. Then again, it looked to Jed as if it
would not be easy to pull the fat boy over with his famous
hand-shake trick.</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll leave me alone,” grinned Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, look out for him, anyway,” warned Frank.</p>

<p>“See that, now!” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>Benny Lane sat on the grass near by, watching some girls
skipping rope. The little crippled lad placed his crutch by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
his side. Suddenly Jed stooped down and picked it up.
Swinging it as he would a club, he struck with all his might
at the croquet ball three feet above his head.</p>

<p>Crack! went the ball, stopped in its flight, and falling to
the ground.</p>

<p>Snap! echoed the crutch end, and went flying straight
through the air, striking a little boy about twenty feet away.</p>

<p>The lad was playing “Duck on the Rock,” and was nearly
knocked over. The crutch end struck his cheek, scratching
and bruising it, and he gave a cry of pain. Then, seeing the
cause of his hurt, he raised the brick he had been playing
with, and hurled it at Jed with an angry cry.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Sammy, as the missile landed on Jed’s
stomach, and sent him reeling back.</p>

<p>The fat boy tried to get out of the way, but Jed stumbled
and went flat. His feet swung out, and down came Tom,
right on top of him.</p>

<p>“Hi! get off!” roared Jed.</p>

<p>“I can’t&mdash;I’m too fat,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Ouch! you’re heavy.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it. Don’t wiggle so&mdash;you’ll tip me over.”</p>

<p>“Help!” whined Jed, all out of breath. “Oh, take him
off!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can’t lift myself,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>Frank, laughing, pulled Tom to his feet. Jed groaned as
if a big load had been lifted from him. He started to get up.
But his misery was not ended yet.</p>

<p>The little fellow he had hit with the crutch end had a
sister, who also attended the school. She was a regular spitfire
in temper. Now she came running up to Jed.</p>

<p>“You great big ape, you!” she cried. “Striking my little
brother!” And she grabbed Jed by the hair and held on.
“You&mdash;hit&mdash;my&mdash;lit-tle&mdash;brother, did you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was an accident,” gasped Jed.</p>

<p>“Take that&mdash;and that! and that!”</p>

<p>Jed roared like a whipped calf. At each word she spoke,
the little miss gave him a hard box on the ears.</p>

<p>By this time every boy and girl on the playground had
gathered at the spot.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! goody!” cried some little girls, clapping their
hands in glee.</p>

<p>“You let go my hair!” blubbered Jed, making a pretty
picture to look at.</p>

<p>“And that!” cried the girl, giving him a last cuff, as he
ran off.</p>

<p>“Cow-ard! cow-ard!” shouted all the little fellows, as
Jed, in shame and disgrace, sneaked away. He left his cap
behind him, and was afraid to come back for it.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Sammy, slapping him on the back, “you fell
down just in time.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I’m so fat, you know!” grinned Tom, and
everybody laughed.</p>

<p>Jed Burr was grumpy all the rest of that day. He kept
away from the games at recess. Bob noticed him and two or
three of his favorite chums talking together in a mysterious
way.</p>

<p>“Tell you, Frank,” he said, a little later, “Jed looks
pretty ugly at us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll get over it,” replied Frank, lightly.</p>

<p>“One of Jed’s friends hinted to me to-day that we’d better
look out.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, Jed Burr is just squelched,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>The seat the teacher gave Tom was not very comfortable
for him. Bob had an end desk, and gave it up to Tom till the
teacher could arrange for some other. Bob took the desk of
a scholar who was absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning was announced for a spelling contest.
This meant high marks for those who spelled best, and there
was a great deal of talk and excitement over it.</p>

<p>“Spelling is about all I know,” said Tom, the next
morning, as he and Bob and the others wended their way to
school.</p>

<p>“Good at it, are you?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Ought to be. My father wouldn’t get me my bicycle last
year until I had the whole spelling book perfect from end to
end. Say, you’ll just see me shine to-day.”</p>

<p>After recess, the teacher named those who were to do the
spelling. Jed Burr was absent, but two or three of his chums
were on the list.</p>

<p>“Alphabet,” “ardent,” “alder,” “animal,” “beauty,”
“blanket”&mdash;there were no mistakes so far. Miss Smith
gave out “cote.”</p>

<p>“C-o-a-t,” said Sammy, proudly.</p>

<p>“Next.”</p>

<p>“C-o-t-e,” spelled Bob.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this.</p>

<p>“Correct,” said the teacher, “I should have explained that
the word meant a pigeon-house.”</p>

<p>There were a lot of misses after that. There was a great
deal of fun, too, for some comical errors were made. One
boy spelled knock “noq.” Another made “kwal” out of quail,
and a pert little girl lisped out “sqwirm” when Miss Smith
gave out the word “worm.”</p>

<p>When the contest was over, Tom, two of Jed’s closest
chums, and Bob received high marks. Tom was older than
most of those in the class, and it was not wondered at that he
did so well. Bob was always at the head of his class. The
great surprise was that the friends of Jed, who like him were
put down as very backward scholars, got high marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob noticed that after the spelling was over Miss Williams
went all through the papers in her desk. She acted quite
thoughtful and serious. After the dinner hour, just before
school commenced that afternoon, a little girl came out to the
playground and spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Miss Williams wants to see you, Bob Bouncer,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I wonder what for?” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>He found Miss Williams alone in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>“Close the door, Bob,” she said, as he entered. “Sit
down,” she added, as he obeyed her and came up to the desk.</p>

<p>The school teacher looked very serious. Bob wondered
what it all meant. He sat waiting for her to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Bob,” said Miss Williams, after quite a pause, “you did
very well in your spelling to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied Bob. “I tried to. I did the best
I could.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any help, Bob?” Miss Williams asked,
looking straight into Bob’s face.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;I don’t know what you mean, Miss Williams,”
said Bob. “Frank and I went over a lot of words at home,
last night.”</p>

<p>“I mean, you had no key, no idea of what words I was
going to give out?” asked the teacher.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no! How could I?”</p>

<p>Miss Williams paused again. It seemed hard for her to
go on, but she finally said:</p>

<p>“Bob, I had two lists of words. One I had copied to send
to a sister who is a teacher in the next township. Both were
in my desk when I left the school last night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“This noon I found one of them missing.”</p>

<p>“Why, who could have taken it?” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sorry,” replied Miss Williams, “but I found it in
your desk.”</p>

<p>“In my desk?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Just now. I searched all the desks. It was in yours,
Bob,” went on Miss Williams, and her voice shook a little.
“I think a great deal of you, and I do not wish to misjudge
you, but you must explain this.”</p>

<p>“Why, how can I?” spoke Bob. “I don’t know anything
about the list.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea how it came in your desk?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;yes, I have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A sudden thought had come into Bob’s mind. It was a
dreadful thought, too. He almost turned pale, he was so
upset. Just like a flash a quick idea made him almost gasp.</p>

<p>“Speak out, Bob,” urged Miss Williams, but Bob was
silent. He hung his head and tried to think out a great
muddle in his mind.</p>

<p>“If you know anything about the missing list, Bob,” went
on his teacher, “you must certainly tell me. If you suspect
any one, it is right you should say so.”</p>

<p>“Miss Williams,” replied Bob, making up his mind and
looking up now, “I could make a guess, but I won’t do it till
I am sure I am right.”</p>

<p>“Bob,” said Miss Williams, “a week from Monday the
school board meets. It is my duty to tell them what has happened.
You know as well as I do that they will suspend or
expel a scholar for using a key to any of the lessons.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t used any key. I never heard of the list
until this minute,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“But you know who did take it. You will have to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
me whom to suspect, or I shall report to the board. That is
all.”</p>

<p>Bob left the schoolroom without another word.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” he said, almost angrily, as he reached the
outside. “I can guess who did it&mdash;and it’s too bad for him,
too,” added Bob Bouncer, gloomily.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="pch">THE MAD BULL</span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">News</span> from the North Pole!” shouted Dick Hazelton,
bounding into the playground, two mornings later.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Frost.”</p>

<p>“When&mdash;where?”</p>

<p>“On the pumpkins! You fellows who live in town don’t
get up early enough to see what’s going on these crisp, bright
days. Get ready for some new fun, fellows.”</p>

<p>“What’s doing?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Nutting.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Sammy.</p>

<p>“Walnuts down in the flats, and hickory nuts over in the
North Woods,” said Dick. “See here, Frank, can’t we get
the fellows to go Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“My crowd will go,” put in Jed Burr.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” laughed Frank, slyly.</p>

<p>“Say, what will I do?” asked Tom. “I’m too fat to climb
trees.”</p>

<p>“You can hold the bag,” chuckled Sammy.</p>

<p>Bob looked at Jed, and then at Tom. Then he walked
away to another part of the playground.</p>

<p>“Hi, Bob!” sang out Sammy, running after him. “Where
are you bound for?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, anyway, the last day or two?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is.”</p>

<p>“I’m sort of feeling cross, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Sammy fell back with a rather glum face, and Bob walked
about alone. He was not feeling cross at all, although he
thought he was. He was thinking.</p>

<p>Bob had felt for two days that he was in disgrace. Miss
Williams showed no change in her manner towards him before
the scholars, but he did not feel as free and friendly with her
as of old.</p>

<p>Bob had worried some, but he had no hard feelings
against anybody. He knew that he was not to blame about
the stolen spelling list. One thing troubled Bob greatly,
however; he believed that Tom Chubb had taken the list
from the teacher’s desk.</p>

<p>That was the very first thought that had come into Bob’s
mind when Miss Williams spoke of the list. Bob hated to
think that Tom could do a mean trick. Something he remembered,
however, helped to turn his mind in that way.</p>

<p>Ever since Tom had come to school, he had told a lot of
stories of the ways down at Springville Academy. The boys
there had taught him a good many tricks, as they called them.</p>

<p>Tom said it was quite usual for the fellows to have key
books and carry notes with them, when they were trying for
a new grade. What was worse, the fat boy did not seem to
see much wrong in these acts.</p>

<p>So Bob had jumped at once to the conclusion that Tom
had stolen the spelling list out of Miss Williams’ desk.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he have every word right?” Bob asked himself.
“How could it come in his desk, or rather my desk, which
he was using, unless he put it in there?”</p>

<p>Only guessing this, however, Bob was not willing to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the teacher the clew. Besides that, he would not betray a
friend. He felt sorry for Tom, and he did not believe he
could trust or like him as he had done.</p>

<p>All this Bob had carried in his mind for two days. He
did not tell Frank or Sammy about it, but he did not feel
very good over the way he was being suspected by the teacher.</p>

<p>“If Tom did take the list,” thought Bob, “and they fasten
it on him, he will certainly be expelled. That would be
pretty bad for his folks, for he didn’t seem to have been a
very bright scholar before.”</p>

<p>Just now, Bob had some new thoughts about the affair.
He had put some facts together that had not at first come to
his mind. He remembered that Jed Burr had not been at
school the day of the spelling test. He remembered, too,
that two of Jed’s chums had come out better than they ever
had before in the spelling.</p>

<p>Putting this and that together, Bob wondered if it could
be possible that Jed had tried to “get even” by getting him
into new trouble, just as he had when the bottle of ink in the
storeroom was found broken.</p>

<p>If Jed had done this, he must have done it after school,
when the teacher and all the scholars were away, and forgetting
that Tom was just then using Bob’s desk.</p>

<p>“I won’t speak to Tom about it, not just yet, anyway,”
decided Bob. “If he didn’t do it, he will feel bad at my
thinking he did. If he was bad enough to do it, he will deny
it, of course. It’s some days before the school board meets.
I’ll just keep quiet, and see how things turn out. I’ll keep a
sharp eye, too, on Jed Burr and his friends.”</p>

<p>Bob was in a better frame of mind by the time the school
bell rang. He crossed the playground slowly. Most of the
scholars had got into the building. Just coming through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
gate, and hurrying along as fast as they could, were Minnie
Grey and little crippled Benny Lane.</p>

<p>Minnie had hold of Benny’s arm and was urging him
along. The little fellow was using his mended crutch the
best he knew how. Minnie wore a red winter cape, for the
mornings were beginning to get quite chill. She was hurrying
so fast that this fell from her shoulders. She did not stop to
pick it up. Instead, she acted as if too frightened to do anything
but run and make Benny keep up with her.</p>

<p>“Why,” cried Bob, suddenly, “that bull is chasing them!”</p>

<p>Just then Bob caught sight of the animal. It came rushing
down the road Minnie and Benny had just left. The bull
was roaring, its head down, its tail lashing the air.</p>

<p>“Hurry! hurry!” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>He ran towards the gate as fast as he could. As he got
between it and the two children, the bull lowered its horns.</p>

<p>There was a post midway in the gate space. The animal
could not get through without getting this out of the way.
Bob saw the bull make a great rush. Its big horns struck the
post, and snapped it off near the ground as if it were a mere
pipe-stem.</p>

<p>Bob cast a quick glance at the two children. They were
still fully fifty feet from the schoolhouse. Minnie was about
dragging Benny along, who had begun to cry in terror.</p>

<p>“It’s Farmer Doane’s big bull, the one he always keeps
shut up,” said Bob. “They say he’s very ugly. He gored and
killed two pigs last week. He must have broken out. It’s
that red cape that roused him up.”</p>

<p>Bob made a run for the spot where the cape lay on the
ground. He snatched it up just in time. The bull with a
great bellow was making a rush after the two children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll have to do some dodging,” thought Bob, “but I’ve
got to keep him away till Minnie and Benny get into the
schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>What Bob tried to do now was to get the attention of the
animal away from the children. He gave the red cape a
fling right into the face of the animal. It fell at one side.
The bull eyed it and made a dash for it.</p>

<p>“Good! they’re safe!” cried Bob, as he saw Minnie and
Benny pass through the open doorway of the schoolhouse.
They fairly fell over the threshold in their wild haste and
fear.</p>

<p>The bull drove its head down at the cape. Then the
animal stamped it to fragments in the soft sod. Then with
a frightful bellow it started for Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a run, and a fast one,” thought Bob.</p>

<p>He made a straight bee-line for the schoolhouse, not
daring to risk looking behind him. He could hear the great
thudding hoofs of the pursuing bull strike the ground hard
and fast.</p>

<p>The animal snorted, and once Bob almost fancied he
could feel its hot breath sweep the back of his neck. At any
rate, it was an eager race.</p>

<p>“I’ve made it!” cried the lad, breathless and excited, as he
bounded over the threshold of the schoolhouse door.</p>

<p>As he did so he knocked over Frank and Sammy, crowding
towards it to see what was going on. Bob had just a
glimpse of crowding, frightened boys and girls.</p>

<p>“Shut the door!” he yelled, and got to his feet to help two
of the scholars to give it a quick slam.</p>

<p>Bob shot the bolt just in time. The door shook violently
the next moment, as the heavy body of the bull grazed it.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Miss Williams, hurrying from her
desk.</p>

<p>“It’s a mad bull,” said Sammy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are the children all in?” asked the teacher, anxiously.</p>

<p>“They’re all right, Miss Williams,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>Just then a frightful scream came from the side of the
room.</p>

<p>Crash! went the lower half of a window, sending splinters
of wood and glass half way across the floor.</p>

<p>The terrified scholars crowded to the other end of the
room, as the bull, with a fierce roar and blood-shot eyes, stuck
its head through the ruined window.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="pch">THE NUTTING PARTY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> schoolroom was in an uproar. Some of the smaller
scholars were crying. Miss Williams looked quite pale.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, children,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, that cow will come in here and eat us all up!”
blubbered one little girl.</p>

<p>“Do not think of going outside,” said the teacher to Bob
and Frank, who went towards the door, while Jed and his
crowd made sure they were safe at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>“We ought to get word to Farmer Doane,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“You must not risk going out,” insisted Miss Williams.</p>

<p>“The bull may go away,” spoke Sammy.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t act like it,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>They watched the animal from the window. The bull did
not move away from the building. He walked around it
twice, rooted up some vines, kicked the door-step loose, and
looked in at the window.</p>

<p>“We are in a state of siege,” said the teacher, “but there is
no danger while we remain indoors.”</p>

<p>This did not, however, quiet the scholars. Nobody
thought of sitting down, and study and order seemed out of
the question.</p>

<p>“Can’t we do something, Bob?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to think if we can.”</p>

<p>“Say, I wouldn’t like to tackle that animal,” said Tom, in
a scared way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s throw something out at him,” suggested Sammy.</p>

<p>“I think I know how to fix things,” said Bob, finally.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“The bull keeps well on this side of the schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>“Just now he does, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come over to the other side and open a
window.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“And let me out, and then shut the window quick.”</p>

<p>“See here, Bob&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry. I may not do all I hope to, but the
bull won’t catch me.”</p>

<p>“He will if he sees you.”</p>

<p>“Not until I’m all safe and sound.”</p>

<p>Frank knew that Bob was bold and brave, but not reckless.
Something had to be done, so he went over to the
window with Bob.</p>

<p>“You watch, and tell us if the bull starts away from that
side of the house,” Bob said to Sammy.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Frank lifted the window quickly. Bob was outside before
Miss Williams knew of it. As he started on a run, Sammy
set up a great shout of warning.</p>

<p>The animal caught sight of Bob as he got past the end of
the building, and started after him. Frank and the others,
curious and breathless, watched Bob as he dashed across the
playground.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be caught!” cried Minnie Grey, in affright.</p>

<p>“No, he won’t,” said Sammy. “I see what he’s after.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;the swing,” guessed Frank.</p>

<p>Bob was too smart to think he could reach the fence before
the bull could come up with him. About a hundred feet from
the schoolhouse was a big swing. Two large dead trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
formed the sides. Across their top was chained a big
wooden log.</p>

<p>Two holes had been bored through the log. The rope, a
thick heavy cable, was run through these, and knotted.</p>

<p>Bob reached the swing well ahead of the bull. He was a
good climber. Spry and nimble, he was up one of the dead
trees in a jiffy. The bull, headed for the swing, arrived under
it as the boy got clear to the cross-piece, and sat astride of it.</p>

<p>The animal moved around the swing in a circle, glaring
up at Bob and bellowing. The lad pulled one knotted end of
the rope up and cut off the knot with his pocket-knife, then
the other.</p>

<p>Now he made a stout slip-knot of one end. The other he
tied around one of the side supports of the swing. He did
not know much about lassoing animals, but the task Bob had
set himself was a pretty easy one.</p>

<p>The bull kept moving around in a ring. Once in a while
it would rush up against one of the trees and prod with its
horns. Then it would glare up at Bob and roar fiercely.</p>

<p>“Now’s my chance,” said Bob, quickly, as the animal
paced almost directly under the log piece on which the boy
sat.</p>

<p>Bob did not fling the rope. He just dropped its looped
end. He was well pleased, as without any tangle with the
horns the loop fell right against the neck of the bull.</p>

<p>The instant the animal felt the rope it reared and shook
its head. Then it started on a run. Bob clung close to the
top beam of the swing, for he guessed what was coming.</p>

<p>The bull was going pell-mell. As the loop of the rope
tightened, it came to a halt so sudden and terrific, that the
animal was forced to its knees.</p>

<p>The swing shook and creaked, but Bob did not feel at all
uneasy. The rope was strong and the sides were solid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Good for Bob!”</p>

<p>Cheers greeted the brave boy as he slid down one side of
the swing and landed safely on the ground. Then he ran his
fastest. There was no need of hurry, he found, as he halted
outside of range of the bull. The animal had got a wrench
that tamed it down a good deal.</p>

<p>Bob saw that the loop was tight as could be about the neck
of the bull. The more the bull tugged, the tighter it became.
The boy started out on a new run, and waved his hand at the
peering faces at the schoolhouse window.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell Farmer Doane,” he shouted.</p>

<p>Bob came back in a quarter of an hour with the farmer.
Mr. Doane brought a leather muzzle and a leading rope, and
soon had the bull under mastery.</p>

<p>Bob felt pleased and proud as he walked into the schoolroom.
The girls were looking at him with beaming eyes.
Tom Chubb could not help giving him a hearty slap on the
shoulder. Miss Williams smiled at him in a grateful way.</p>

<p>It took some time for the school to quiet down. Before
studies were taken up, a little scrap of folded paper passed
from hand to hand till it reached Bob. When he opened
it, he read:</p>

<p class="p1">“You are a reel heero, Bob Bouncer.</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Minnie</span>,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Benny</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">At recess the little fellows crowded about Bob as if he
was a hero, indeed, and the girls said all kinds of nice things
about him.</p>

<p>Bob still had in mind the trouble about the stolen spelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
list. He felt a good deal better now, however, than he had
done before.</p>

<p>Miss Williams was kinder to him. Jed Burr was uglier
than ever.</p>

<p>Everybody looked forward to Saturday with a good deal
of pleasure and excitement. About a dozen of the boys were
going with the nutting party. They were to meet at a crossroads
just south of the town.</p>

<p>Bob, Frank and Sammy were on hand bright and early,
each provided with a good-sized feed bag and some lunch.
Jed and his friends came upon the scene a little later.</p>

<p>Tom Chubb arrived panting and late. He went on to
tell one of his wonderful stories about a dream he had about
being in a cocoanut forest, and hated to wake up from it.</p>

<p>“I say, Tom,” remarked Frank, “you’ve brought no bag.”</p>

<p>“Me? Guess not,” replied Tom, smartly, sticking his
hands in his pockets, and strutting around.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, I carried things for some fellows once,” chuckled
Tom, “and I don’t do it again in a hurry.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed heartily at this hint of the time when
some chums at Springville Academy got Tom to carry a heavy
chain several miles to tap a bee-tree that did not exist.</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Tom, “I’m too fat to climb trees, so I’m
no use except to have fun with.”</p>

<p>The party trooped down the pleasant country road, joking,
singing, and hailing every farmer they met. Dick Hazelton
met them about half a mile out of town.</p>

<p>“Here’s our guide,” shouted Sammy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Dick, “and I’m going to lead you to the biggest
raft of hickory nuts you ever laid your eyes on.”</p>

<p>“Jolly!” shouted Sammy, waving his cap in glee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I went over to the flats this morning early,” said Dick.
“I tell you the nuts are prime for picking.”</p>

<p>Jed and his crowd kept pretty well to themselves. As
the crowd reached another cross-road they started down it.</p>

<p>“Hold on, there,” shouted Dick.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Jed.</p>

<p>“That’s the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“It’s right enough for us,” retorted Jed, smartly.</p>

<p>“This road is the shortest one to the flats.”</p>

<p>Jed did not reply, but with his party swung off on the
cross-road.</p>

<p>“They’re up to something,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is?” asked Sammy.</p>

<p>“Something to spoil our fun, I’m sure,” spoke Tom. “It’s
just like them.”</p>

<p>“I think they’re going to run for it when they get out of
sight,” said Dick. “They are aiming to make a cross cut and
reach the flats first.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they think they’ll gather up all the nuts. Huh!
there’s a month’s picking for ten schools.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="pch">“THE DAY OF THEIR LIVES”</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys kept on their way. As they reached the farm
where Dick lived, he took them all into the dairy. His
mother came out and welcomed the crowd. She brought half
a dozen tin cups.</p>

<p>“Now then, boys,” she said, passing these around, “Dick
will show you where the buttermilk is.”</p>

<p>“Say,” spoke Tom, as he helped himself to the second cup
of the cool, refreshing buttermilk, “I’d like to live here.”</p>

<p>“Jed’s crowd are missing it, I tell you,” said Sammy,
smacking his lips.</p>

<p>“Dick, this is just fine,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazelton came out with a package of home-made
cheese to add to the lunch, and the boys greeted her with a
cheer and started briskly on their way.</p>

<p>Their guide led them to a fence, over it, and through a
dry watercourse.</p>

<p>“Here we are, fellows,” he announced, pointing to a
scattered grove of trees on the rise opposite.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Sammy. “I feel like a squirrel.”</p>

<p>The crowd placed their lunches under a shady tree and
started over for the hickory grove. Soon each one, except
Tom, was scrambling up a tree.</p>

<p>“There’s a rather low one over yonder,” said Tom to Bob.
“I guess I’ll tackle it.”</p>

<p>“What with?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom drew a stout slung-shot from his pocket. Then he
rambled along the watercourse, and filled an old fruit basket
he had found with good-sized pebbles.</p>

<p>The next hour was a jolly one for the happy crowd. There
were some mishaps, but only amounting to scratches and
scrapes. The shaken limbs of the trees rained down hickory
nuts like hailstones.</p>

<p>Bob came back to the tree where he had left Tom to find
his friend lying fast asleep on the grass. A little pile of
hickory nuts lay near his coat and cap.</p>

<p>“Had lots of fun,” Tom declared, when he woke up. “I’m
not a very good shot, though.”</p>

<p>All hands were soon ready for lunch. Nearly every bag
was filled. The boys were pleased with their success, and it
was a gay crowd that enjoyed the dinner under the trees.</p>

<p>“What now?” asked Sammy, when he had eaten his fill.</p>

<p>“Walnuts next,” replied Dick.</p>

<p>“What will we do with the hickories?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave them here,” said Dick. “Bring along the
empty bags, and we’ll go up to the North Woods after the
walnuts.”</p>

<p>“It will be some tramping, each lugging two bags home,”
spoke Sammy.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to do that,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“When we get all the bags full, I’ll go home and get a
wagon and team.”</p>

<p>“That will be fine,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Say, Dick,” spoke Frank, “what do you suppose has
become of Jed and his crowd?”</p>

<p>“They must have taken in the walnut trees first,” replied
Dick.</p>

<p>The route to the North Woods took the boys along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
road where Jed and his friends had left them earlier in the
morning. As they came up to a farmhouse Dick said:</p>

<p>“Farmer Griggs lives here. We’ll go in and get a good
cool drink of well water.”</p>

<p>They trooped into the farm-yard. They were all gathered
about the well when an old man came out from the house.</p>

<p>“How’dy, Dick,” he said. “Mornin’, lads. Hey, lost any
of your friends?”</p>

<p>“Have you found any, Mr. Griggs?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I have, for a fact,” replied the farmer, with a grin, “six
of them.”</p>

<p>“He means Jed and the others,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Where are the friends you spoke of, Mr. Griggs?” asked
Dick, guessing.</p>

<p>“Treed. Just step this way, so you can see the orchard,
and you’ll understand what I mean,” replied the farmer, with
a grim chuckle.</p>

<p>The boys trooped eagerly after the farmer. Behind the
barns of the place was a small fenced-in orchard. The trees
hung heavy with red, luscious fruit. More than one of the
boys knew of the fine fruit that came from the Griggs farm
and was on sale in the village every fall and winter.</p>

<p>“After you’ve looked a bit, lads,” said the farmer, “you
can go and eat your fill. I’ve no objection to any orderly
boys helping themselves to an apple or two, but when it comes
to stealing bagfuls, though, and breaking whole limbs off
the trees, I can’t stand it. There’s the fellows I spoke of,”
added Mr. Griggs, coming to a halt.</p>

<p>Inside the orchard were four big dogs. They did not
look so fierce and ugly, but there was something about them
that told one they knew how to protect the property of their
owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Each one of the animals lay on the grass under a tree,
its head between its paws, its eyes fixed up among the
branches overhead. Among these, two in one tree, the boys
made out Jed and his companions.</p>

<p>“How long have they been there, Mr. Griggs?” asked
Dick, his face on a broad grin.</p>

<p>“About three hours.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t dared to come down on account of the dogs&mdash;I
see,” said Frank, smiling.</p>

<p>“They may now,” answered the farmer. “I guess they’ve
had a good dose this time.”</p>

<p>He whistled to the dogs, opened the gate for them to pass
out, and waved his hand towards the treed captives.</p>

<p>“Hey, you fellows!” he shouted, “you can go on your way
now.”</p>

<p>Jed and his friends climbed down from the trees. They
sneaked for the further corner of the fence away from their
amused schoolmates.</p>

<p>“They look pretty forlorn, for a fact,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>“Go in and help yourselves, lads,” invited Farmer Griggs,
opening the gate for Bob and his friends to pass through.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, you’re awful kind,” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>“Just pick the windfalls,” directed the farmer. “Hey!”
as the boys rushed gladly for the trees, “as you go over the
next fence you’ll find a little melon patch. You take two of
the late watermelons&mdash;no more, mind you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that they obey orders, Mr. Griggs,” promised
Dick, “and&mdash;thank you!”</p>

<p>“Many thanks!” shouted the others.</p>

<p>The boys ate two or three apples apiece and stowed as
many more in their pockets. Then there was a rush for the
melon patch. Bob and Dick came out into the road, each
carrying a big fat melon of the late variety that looked ripe
and tempting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, say, isn’t this glorious!” cried Sammy, as they all
sat down under a tree by the roadside, and Dick got out his
pocket-knife.</p>

<p>Jed and his friends sat on a fallen tree about fifty yards
distant. They watched the boys enviously, while not getting
slivers out of their hands and the creases out of their clothes.</p>

<p>“Come on, Burr, and all of you,” cried Dick, in a pleasant,
open-hearted way.</p>

<p>Jed and his companions skulked up to the spot, rather
shame-faced. No one referred to their long roost in the apple-trees.
Sammy, however, had to laugh outright when it came
out that they had left their lunches on the ground, and the
dogs had eaten them up.</p>

<p>Bob and his friends divided what they had in their pockets
with Jed’s party. This and a watermelon made the deserters
feel a good deal better.</p>

<p>All hands went to the North Woods, and put in two hours
gathering walnuts. About three o’clock Dick and Bob
started off for the Hazelton farm, leaving their comrades in
the woods.</p>

<p>Dick got a team and a light wagon at the farm. First,
he and Bob drove over to the flat and loaded in the bags of
hickory nuts.</p>

<p>Then they drove around into the North Woods, and the
walnuts were safely stowed. The boys crowded into the
wagon on top of them.</p>

<p>“Say, this feels good,” said Tom, as he rested his tired
limbs.</p>

<p>“Never had such a grand day in my life!” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>The team took the boys around to their homes. Even
Jed Burr voted that they had enjoyed a fine occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob was so tired he could hardly do his evening chores,
and he was glad to get to bed early. All the next day, too,
he had to keep his scratched hands rubbed with grease. His
knees were pretty sore from climbing.</p>

<p>Monday morning he woke up with a start. A loud voice
sounded in the yard below, and Bob ran to the window, wondering
at the commotion. He heard the window in his
father’s room pushed up.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called down Mr. Bouncer to Mr.
Haven, his neighbor, who, quite pale and excited, had just
breathlessly called out to him.</p>

<p>“Get up quick, Mr. Bouncer&mdash;the jewelry store has been
robbed!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="pch">ROBBERY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">“Robbed!</span>” echoed Mr. Bouncer, in great surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, of nearly everything of value it contained.”</p>

<p>“You amaze me,” said Bob’s father.</p>

<p>“My brother just notified me,” went on Mr. Haven. “I
wish you would come down to the store with me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, at once,” replied Mr. Bouncer.</p>

<p>Bob was greatly excited at the news. He ran for his
clothes and got them on in a hurry. Then he bounded down
the stairs. By this time his father had joined Mr. Haven,
and the two gentlemen were hurrying down the street towards
the center of the village.</p>

<p>Bob started to run after them, when he saw Frank just
leaving the yard of his own house. He waited till Frank
came up, all in a flurry, buttoning up his coat as if he had
put it on in haste.</p>

<p>“Frank, the store has been robbed, I heard your father
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Frank. “He’s terribly worried about it.
You know, he borrowed a lot of money to buy it out and start
my uncle in business.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard so.”</p>

<p>“It would about ruin him if the thieves took much.”</p>

<p>“Your father says they did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not&mdash;my uncle may be mistaken.”</p>

<p>As the boys, following their fathers, turned into the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
business street of the town, they noticed a crowd gathered in
front of the jewelry store.</p>

<p>Early as the hour was, the village marshal had already
reached the place. The boys expected to see the windows
smashed, or the doors broken in, but there was not a sign of
disorder about the place. The show windows and the shelves
looked as neat and orderly as usual.</p>

<p>Frank and Bob went inside the store. They found the
marshal and the others standing in front of the large iron safe
at the end of the store. Its massive doors stood open. Its
drawers were pulled out and scattered on the floor, and its
shelves were empty.</p>

<p>“Gone&mdash;all gone!” groaned Mr. Haven, turning very pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, they have taken everything there was in the safe,”
said his brother.</p>

<p>“When did you find it out?” asked the marshal.</p>

<p>“Not half an hour ago,” was the reply. “I came down
earlier than usual, because I had some hurry repairing orders.
I let myself in and then I noticed the open safe.”</p>

<p>“It’s a weak, old-fashioned iron box,” said the marshal,
looking the safe over. “I often told Jones it wasn’t any good.
The robbers pried it open easily.”</p>

<p>“But how did they get into the store?” asked Mr. Bouncer.</p>

<p>“That is the mystery,” replied Frank’s uncle. “The door
was locked as usual, and the window-catches all in place.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, they must have had a key,” said the marshal.</p>

<p>“Evidently they did.”</p>

<p>“The lost key&mdash;do you remember?” Bob whispered to
Frank, in an excited tone.</p>

<p>“Some one found it!”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“And let himself in here! Who could have done it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Bob could reply, Mr. Haven sank into a chair with
a groan.</p>

<p>“They have taken everything,” he declared, “the silverware,
the watches and chains, and all the solid gold goods we
carried.”</p>

<p>“Did they amount to much?” asked the marshal.</p>

<p>“Over five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Too bad! My assistant watchman and myself patrolled
the town all night. He reported no suspicious persons about,
and I saw none.”</p>

<p>“They got in easily, and took what they liked.”</p>

<p>Neither Frank nor Bob ate much breakfast that morning.
They were too excited to think of anything except the robbery.
When they started for school the whole village was aroused
over the robbery. Everybody was talking about it. When
they got to the schoolhouse even the smallest scholars spoke
of the event.</p>

<p>Frank felt pretty bad. Bob was very sorry for Mr.
Haven. He told Frank so, and tried to cheer up his chum.</p>

<p>“The robbers must have been strangers,” he said.</p>

<p>“I think that,” returned Frank.</p>

<p>“The marshal has got half a dozen men started in different
directions. They are bound to get some idea of the
way the thieves have gone.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Why, they even locked the door after them
when they went away! My father has offered two hundred
dollars reward.”</p>

<p>Bob did not do much studying that day. When school
was over in the afternoon he went home with Frank to hear
if anything had been heard of the robbers.</p>

<p>Mr. Haven was seated on the porch, talking gloomily with
a lawyer. Mrs. Haven was about her work as usual, but
looked very serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the news, Frank?” asked Bob, after Frank had
gone into the house and had seen his mother.</p>

<p>“They haven’t caught the robbers.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer how the fellows have gotten away without
being seen, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, Bob, and that’s what puzzles the marshal, my
mother says.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back after supper, Frank,” said Bob. “I wonder
if Sammy will be over?”</p>

<p>“He said he would,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“All right, I may want you to go somewhere with me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you after supper.”</p>

<p>Bob went away, very thoughtful. He was doing much
thinking. At the corner of two streets he stood still for a
long time, as if trying to make up his mind to something.</p>

<p>“It can’t do any harm to follow out my idea,” he said to
himself and started up quickly.</p>

<p>Bob went straight to the home of Miss Simmons. He
had not seen her since the day he had noticed the tramp leave
the place. Bob found her seated in a rocking-chair on the
porch, sewing.</p>

<p>“Why, how do you do, Bob?” said the old maid. “I
thought you were coming to see me? I wanted to give you
something for helping me get back those letters.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything for that, Miss Simmons,” replied
Bob, “but there’s something else you can do for me, if you
will.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know if that tramp I saw here brought you
back those four letters.”</p>

<p>Miss Simmons flushed and fidgeted. Then she asked,
sharply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you told anybody about the letters, Bob?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, not a soul.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good boy, Bob; a very good boy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Simmons.”</p>

<p>“And about those letters&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“The man you speak of did bring them back.”</p>

<p>“I thought that. Miss Simmons, have you seen him since
the day you lost the letters?”</p>

<p>The old maid looked troubled. Then she glanced sharply
at Bob.</p>

<p>“What are you asking that for?” she said.</p>

<p>“Because I believe he has been up to some mischief,”
replied the boy. “If I knew all about his dealings with you,
it might help me find out what I am after.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bob,” said the lady, “he is certainly a very bad
man. He found those letters, and nearly scared me to death
saying he would print them if I didn’t pay him to get them
back. I gave him all the money I had. He wanted more.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sixty dollars, ten in cash.”</p>

<p>“The rascal!”</p>

<p>“He made me give him a note for that fifty dollars. Then
he asked me who would cash it. He got out of me that Mr.
Silas Dolby did that kind of business. I suppose he placed
the note with him.”</p>

<p>“That explains how I came to see the tramp at the old
miser’s house the night Frank lost the key to the jewelry
store,” thought Bob.</p>

<p>“Early yesterday morning,” went on Miss Simmons, “the
man came to the back door here. He had another man with
him.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a man?” asked Bob, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“A man with a green shade over one eye.”</p>

<p>Bob could hardly keep from crying out. He was sure
now that the two men he had heard talk about robbery in
the bluff hide-out, had been in Fairview the day previous.</p>

<p>“He wanted something to eat,” said the old maid. “I gave
them their breakfast. Then the man asked for some money.
I told him I had given him all I intended to. He acted sort
of ugly, and I said I would call the marshal if he troubled
me any more. Then he went away pretty quick.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Simmons,” said Bob. “You have told
me just what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“It won’t&mdash;won’t mix me in anything about those letters?”
asked the old maid.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I haven’t mentioned about them, and I
shan’t. The man won’t bother you any more, either, Miss
Simmons.”</p>

<p>Bob left the place with big thoughts in his mind. He was
only a boy, but he felt that he had found out something that
a grown man would be glad to learn.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do something about that robbery,” said Bob
to himself. “I hardly know what just yet, but I’ll think out
some way.”</p>

<p>It was just after supper that Bob went over to the Haven
place. Frank and Sammy were waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Any news of the robbers yet?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” replied Frank. “The marshal says he can’t
find that any tramps or strangers have been hanging around
town lately.”</p>

<p>Bob said nothing. He kept it to himself that the town
marshal was mistaken.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows,” he said, “I want you to join me in a
hunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eh? What kind of a hunt?” asked Sammy, with great
interest.</p>

<p>“Not a treasure hunt, mind you,” replied Bob, with a
faint smile, remembering Sammy’s weakness.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Sammy, flushing up, “what kind of a hunt,
then?”</p>

<p>“I want to see if we can’t find the men who robbed Mr.
Haven’s jewelry store,” replied Bob.</p>

<span class="pch">BOB BOUNCER’S CLEW</span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Try</span> to catch the robbers?” gasped Frank, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bob, in a way that showed he was very
much in earnest.</p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t it be grand if we could!” cried Sammy.
“Why, there’s a reward of two hundred dollars for that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we wouldn’t take it from Mr. Haven,” said
Bob, quickly.</p>

<p>“That’s so, I forgot,” replied Sammy, readily.</p>

<p>“Have you found out something, Bob?” asked Frank,
seriously.</p>

<p>“I think I have.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Sammy.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you all at once,” replied Bob. “There’s just
this, though, fellows; I know that two tramps were in town
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“You do!” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you think they are the robbers?”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure of it. Frank, do you remember my
telling you about the two men hiding on the bluff the night
of the bonfire?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob.”</p>

<p>“And how they were talking about robbing somebody?”</p>

<p>“And you told your father, and he got the marshal to look
for them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“But they got out of town.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, those fellows were here again yesterday.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” exclaimed Sammy.</p>

<p>“Yes, they were. I’m going to tell you something else.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“You know, we thought you lost the key to your father’s
jewelry store in Silas Dolby’s yard?”</p>

<p>“I know I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve found out that one of the tramps knows Mr.
Dolby. In fact, he was at his house right after you lost the
key.”</p>

<p>“Why, Bob,” cried Sammy, “then old Dolby broke into
the jewelry store?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no, I can’t know that,” said Bob, quickly. “I
don’t say so, either.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m just putting this and that together.”</p>

<p>“I should think you were!” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“We know that Mr. Dolby has a bad name, and is
tricky and all that, but he wouldn’t rob a neighbor,” went on
Bob. “He knows one of the robbers, though. I happen to
know he has had business with him. Mr. Dolby may not
know that the tramp is a bad man, but somehow or other I
can’t get it out of my head that the key to the jewelry store
Frank lost was the one that was used by the robbers.”</p>

<p>“We know it was, Bob,” spoke Frank. “There were only
two keys, and my uncle had the other.”</p>

<p>“How the robbers got hold of it, I don’t know. I can think
of a way, but it’s only a guess.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Bob?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Dolby may have spoken of your losing it in
his yard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so.”</p>

<p>“And the robber hunted for it and found it.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to find out?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bob, “I thought we’d go down to Mr.
Dolby’s place, and hang around and watch it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the robbers are there now,” cried Sammy,
quickly.</p>

<p>“The marshal says he believes they are in hiding somewhere
near Fairview,” said Frank. “They had to have two
big satchels to handle all the stuff they stole. Anybody
seeing two men carrying big satchels would remember them.
The marshal says he and his men have gone over every road
in the county, and they haven’t found a trace of the robbers.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll try too,” spoke Bob, with a good deal of
confidence.</p>

<p>“Say,” observed Sammy, “hadn’t we ought to have stars?”</p>

<p>“Why, what for?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“To arrest the robbers.”</p>

<p>Bob laughed outright.</p>

<p>“You great detective!” he railed. “Badges and clubs, and
horse-pistols, too, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you expect to catch the robbers?”</p>

<p>“I hope to find out something about them to tell the
marshal, yes,” replied Bob. “Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>Bob led the way to the dismal abode where the old miser
lived. He halted under a tree near the fence of the place.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” he said to Frank and Sammy, “stay here
till I skirmish around a bit.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied his companions, in a breath.</p>

<p>Bob went slowly and cautiously all around the fenced-in
lot. He made sure that the big vicious dog old Dolby owned
was chained up and asleep. The house looked dark and
dreary, as usual, except in the living-room, where the miser
passed most of his time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob vaulted the fence and got down on hands and knees.
He crept across the garden without making any noise, and
paused right under the window of the room where there was
a light. He could hear some one moving about inside.
Finally, Bob ventured to raise his head and peer past the
ragged end of a curtain. For fully five minutes the boy
watched the miser. Then he went back to his friends.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dolby is in the house,” replied Bob, “but I didn’t
see any one else.”</p>

<p>“Then the robbers aren’t there,” broke in Sammy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, keep on watching for a spell,” replied Bob, “and
thinking.”</p>

<p>Bob wondered if he had better not go and tell the marshal
all that he knew. The boy kept quiet until Sammy spoke in
a quick whisper the words:</p>

<p>“Bob, old Dolby is coming outside!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s got a lantern,” continued Sammy.</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Bob. “Keep quiet and watch!”</p>

<p>They saw the miser go out to the old rickety barn at the
rear of the lot. The dog growled, but quieted down at a
snarl from his master. Bob ducked down as he ran along
the fence and got behind the barn.</p>

<p>He could see, through broad cracks in the barn, its owner
slowly climbing a cleat ladder at one corner, carrying the
lantern with him. There was a shed near the barn. Its slanting
roof came almost up to the loft of the barn.</p>

<p>Bob could see into this part of the building clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
through gaping breaks in the rotted boards. The miser had
set down the lantern. There was no hay in the loft, except a
little heap in one corner. Upon this was spread a blanket.</p>

<p>“Some one has been sleeping in the loft,” Bob decided.
“He’s gone now, though.”</p>

<p>Silas Dolby took up the blanket and folded it. Then he
took some dishes, a cup, plate, knife and fork from an old
chair. These he placed on top of the folded blanket. He
held blanket, dishes and lantern on one arm. Then he came
down the ladder. In a few minutes the miser went back into
the house.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all plain,” said Bob to himself. “Some one
has been sleeping and hiding in the barn. Who could it be
but that tramp? Then, if he robbed the jewelry store, where
did he put the stuff he stole?”</p>

<p>Bob went back to Frank and Sammy. He had about made
up his mind to go straight to Mr. Haven, and tell him all he
had found out. It was Bob’s idea that Frank’s father and the
marshal could scare the old miser into telling enough about
the tramp to lead to his arrest.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, where are they?” exclaimed Bob, as he
reached the tree where he had left Frank and Sammy.</p>

<p>They were nowhere to be seen. As Bob looked around,
somewhat puzzled, a sound came from some near bushes.</p>

<p>“Hist!”</p>

<p>Bob strained his eyes and made out Frank near the
bushes. He beckoned to Bob.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bob. “What are you hiding for?”</p>

<p>“Some one crossed over from behind the barn.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“A stranger, so Sammy has cut through the brush lot here
to keep him in sight.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on, I’ll show you,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Both boys stole silently across the lot. They ran upon
Sammy near some trees.</p>

<p>“He’s just turned into the road yonder,” panted Sammy.</p>

<p>Bob hurried to the spot where Sammy pointed. He saw
a man going down the highway whom he thought he had
never seen before. He was certainly a stranger to Fairview.
The man had a cane, and was bent over it as if he was old
or sick.</p>

<p>“Where did he come from?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Beyond Dolby’s barn,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see him near it,” said Bob, “but maybe he went
out of a door on the far side of the barn.”</p>

<p>“Is he the man you know about, Bob?” asked Sammy.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look like it,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I saw him pretty plain when I sneaked over here,” spoke
Sammy. “He looks like a tramp.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” broke in Bob, “that’s queer.”</p>

<p>“What is queer?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, just as the man came near that first house,” said
Bob, “he stooped more and walked more lame. That looks
as if the man was playing off.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s sort of suspicious,” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” added Bob, “we want to keep that man in
sight. He may lead us to something worth finding out!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="pch">AN EXCITING HOUR</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Do</span> you suppose that man is one of the robbers?” asked
Sammy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” replied Bob. “But he doesn’t
act right.”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t any more lame than I am,” declared Frank.</p>

<p>“Just look at him,” spoke Bob, quickly.</p>

<p>Some one was coming down the street. The minute the
man saw the boys were following him, he began to act like
a weak old man. He spoke to the other man in a whining
kind of a tone. Bob cut across a yard to head off the man
the stranger had spoken to. He found him to be Mr. Dale,
the village postmaster.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dale,” spoke Bob, “will you please tell me what
that man who stopped you just now said to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you, Bob? Why, yes, he is a beggar and he
asked me for a nickel. He says he is trying to get to Bartonville.
Was hurt in an accident, he told me, and his eyesight
is nearly gone. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I was just curious about him. Thank you, Mr.
Dale.”</p>

<p>Bob bolted off and got back to his friends. He told them
what Mr. Dale had said. Then he added:</p>

<p>“Now, then, fellows, we’re going to follow that man. I
feel sure he isn’t honest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, either,” said Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Keep close inside the yards. We don’t want to have him
suspect that we’re after him.”</p>

<p>Frank and Sammy did just as Bob told them to do. Sammy
was in his element. He found himself in the midst of a
mystery, as he called it, and was greatly excited.</p>

<p>The man they were following kept along the street. The
boys skulked from place to place inside of yards and across
vacant lots. They knew the neighborhood well, and were
never at a loss to get ahead.</p>

<p>When the man came to where the streets were more deserted
and the houses further apart, he began to move faster.</p>

<p>“See that,” said Bob. “He can walk straight as an arrow
when he wants to!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he is just putting on his lameness and all that,”
added Frank.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” whispered Sammy, “see where he’s going
now!”</p>

<p>They had reached the edge of the town. The man ahead
of them had crossed a stretch that was a lonely patch of high
weeds and bushes.</p>

<p>“He’s making for the schoolhouse,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is,” spoke Sammy.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;see,” added Bob, “he’s stopped near the old water
hole where they used to graze the cattle.”</p>

<p>The three boys were crowded up against a fence, and kept
staring after the man and noticing every move he made. He
stood still near the spot Bob had mentioned. Then he put his
fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>The boys caught the echo of a soft birdlike call. They
breathlessly watched the man’s figure as it stood outlined
against the sky. Then in a minute or two there came a reply
to the whistle.</p>

<p>“This is getting exciting,” said Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Listen,” ordered Bob.</p>

<p>The man they had followed replied to the last whistle.
Then the boys saw another man come from some shrubbery
just beyond the schoolhouse wall.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” gasped Bob.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Frank.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The last man! He’s carrying two satchels!”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” said Sammy, “they’ve got the stolen jewelry
in them!”</p>

<p>“S-sh!” warned Bob.</p>

<p>He was terribly excited. Not for an instant did he doubt
that the satchels held the plunder of which the robbers had
rifled Mr. Haven’s jewelry store. Bob thought it out this
way: These two men were the thieves. They had not risked
carrying their plunder away from Fairview, knowing they
would be pursued, but had hidden it. Then they had gone
into hiding themselves. The tramp whom Bob knew had
found shelter in Silas Dolby’s barn. The other man had
found safety in some other spot.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” spoke Bob, quickly, “you, Sammy.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” replied Sammy, on pins and needles of excitement.</p>

<p>“Run as fast as you can to town, and tell the marshal that
the jewelry store robbers are down here near the schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll run!” said Sammy. “But will they be here
when we get back?”</p>

<p>“Probably not, but they won’t be far away.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I will keep them in sight, and Frank will help me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope we catch them!” said Sammy.</p>

<p>“Don’t delay.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Sammy sneaked along the fence until he got out of range
of the men. Then he arose to his feet, and got out of sight
in the direction of the village in a flash.</p>

<p>“What are those men doing now?” asked Frank, a moment
later.</p>

<p>Bob craned his neck and bent his ear. He could hear
only the vague murmur of voices. He could not make out
any clear words. The last man to come on the scene kept
the satchels, one in each hand. Finally the two men started
off. They seemed to be wrangling about something.</p>

<p>“Frank,” said Bob, “all we’ve got to do now is not to lose
sight of those men.”</p>

<p>“Till the marshal catches up with us,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get nearer to them.”</p>

<p>“It’s risky.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to find out all I can.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Follow very slowly. If they see me or anything happens
we don’t expect, don’t you lose sight of them till the
marshal comes.”</p>

<p>“All right, Bob. Oh, I do hope they are the people you
think they are, and that father is going to get back his
property!”</p>

<p>Bob now began crawling flat on the ground across the
open field. When he came to where the weeds or bushes were
high he ran a bit, but kept stooping as low as he could all of
the time.</p>

<p>In this way, Bob had gained quite a little on the men.
Once they rested, near a little clump of shrubbery just beyond
the schoolhouse. The man Bob believed to be the tramp went
ahead, as if seeing if the road was clear. The other man sat
down on one of the satchels, and the boy got quite near to
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the man I saw in the hide-out!” whispered Bob to
himself. “It’s the man with the green shade over his eye!
Now I am sure these men are the fellows who broke into the
jewelry store.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s safe to go on,” said the tramp, coming back
to his friend.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll carry one of the satchels.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; they’re not heavy.”</p>

<p>“But I want to.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t, and I won’t let you.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said the tramp in an angry way, “what’s the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, I know you,” said the other man.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I shan’t drop these satchels till we get to
where the man who hired us is waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“It’s two miles away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it’s ten miles away. If you got your paws
on one of these satchels, you might bolt with it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve done some of the work, haven’t I? Who
found the key to the jewelry store?”</p>

<p>“You did, and our boss will pay you well for your share
of the work, but you don’t handle these satchels.”</p>

<p>“I bet I do!”</p>

<p>The tramp suddenly sprang at his companion, but the
other was too quick for him. The man with the green shade
over his eye sprang to his feet. He whirled one satchel
around. It struck the tramp on the head and swept him to
the ground.</p>

<p>The man with the green shade over his eye at once picked
up the two satchels, and started on a run. In a minute he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
around the corner of the schoolhouse and out of sight. The
tramp sprang to his feet with an angry cry.</p>

<p>Bob did not dare to move from the shelter of the shrubbery
at once. He thought he heard something drop around
on the other side of the schoolhouse. As the tramp ran around
its end, Bob hurried forward and peered towards the road.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Bob, in great surprise, “what has become of
the satchels?”</p>

<p>He could see the man in the lead about two hundred
yards away, as he jumped into a ditch and was gone from
sight. The tramp was putting after him as fast as he could.
One thing was sure: neither of them had the satchels.</p>

<p>“Where could they have gone to?” Bob asked himself.</p>

<p>He ran to the road. The tramp was standing in the
middle of it, at a loss where to go. The other man was
nowhere to be seen. Finally the tramp ran into some woods
lining the road, on a search for the man who had run away
from him.</p>

<p>Frank, who had kept track of Bob in cautious stages,
came up to him now.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Somewhere in the woods,” answered Bob. “They have
had a quarrel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed it.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t do much if we caught up to them. Hark,
Frank!”</p>

<p>Down the road beyond the schoolhouse echoed the sound
of horses’ hoofs and wagon wheels.</p>

<p>“It’s some one driving awfully fast,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“It must be the marshal! Yes, I think it is,” said Bob,
peering down the road.</p>

<p>Then he ran to the middle of the highway, and down it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
waving his arms. The wagon stopped, and Bob saw that it
held the marshal, and three other men, and Sammy.</p>

<p>“Where are those men, Bob?” asked the marshal, quickly.</p>

<p>Bob told enough to give the officer an idea of how things
stood. The marshal drove the wagon up to the side of the
road, and then he and two of the men who had come in the
wagon started out to scour the woods.</p>

<p>Bob told Frank and Sammy about the two satchels being
gone when he ran around the schoolhouse corner. They at
once began a search all about the place and even out to the
ditch, but found no trace of the valises.</p>

<p>“See here, Bob,” said Frank, “maybe the man threw them
into the ditch, jumped after them, and got away with them?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think that,” replied Bob. “He didn’t have
them with him the last sight I had of him.”</p>

<p>The boys had a long wait of it. It was over an hour
before one of the men came back.</p>

<p>“We’ve beat the woods in every direction,” he told them.
“The marshal and his aid have kept up the hunt. We’re to
go back and start some more men on the chase.”</p>

<p>Up to the time, two hours later, that Bob, Frank and
Sammy stayed up, no trace was found of the jewelry store
robbers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="pch">FIRE</span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">You</span> quit that, Jed Burr!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, or I’ll lam you worse.”</p>

<p>Bob Bouncer paused as he was on a run to join Frank and
the others across the playground.</p>

<p>Bob was passing the row of shrubbery, from which he
had spied the jewelry store robbers the night before. Now,
halting and peering through those same bushes, he saw Jed
cuffing a helpless member of his crowd, three years his junior
and about half his size.</p>

<p>This was Ned Thomas, a weak, timid little fellow, who
was so afraid of the big leader of “The Blues,” that he had
fetched and carried for Jed all the last school term. Jed
imposed on him terribly. The way he held the little fellow,
was to make him believe he would work him into the ball
nine in time.</p>

<p>Ned was sobbing and crying. Jed had knocked his cap
off. He threatened him with his fists.</p>

<p>“You do as I say,” he was speaking now.</p>

<p>“I can’t, I won’t,” choked out Ned. “I just felt splendid
at my luck in writing what I did. And you’ve taken it.”</p>

<p>“I gave you mine.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Yours! You give it back to me, Jed Burr! If
you don’t, I’ll go home. I won’t go to school at all.”</p>

<p>“Do it, then,” shouted Jed. “See here,” seizing the little
fellow, and shaking him hard, “you blab one word, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
won’t let a fellow in the crowd play with you, or even speak
to you.”</p>

<p>“See here, Jed Burr, you drop that,” cried Bob, stepping
into view and pulling Ned away from the grasp of the bully.</p>

<p>“Hello! sneaking around, are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to sneak,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Mind your own business.”</p>

<p>“I’m minding it fine when I save a little fellow from your
meanness.”</p>

<p>“Say, I’ll lick you,” cried Jed, doubling up his fists.</p>

<p>Bob said nothing. He just looked the bully squarely in
the eye.</p>

<p>“Some time. You see if I don’t,” added Jed.</p>

<p>Bob did not move. Jed edged away.</p>

<p>“I’ll give it to you good and hard,” scowled Jed, and
went clear away.</p>

<p>“See here, Ned,” said Bob, going up to the weeping boy,
and placing his hand on his shoulder in a kindly way.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone,” sniffled the little fellow. “Jed has
spoiled everything. I’ll stay away from school. I’ll play
hookey.”</p>

<p>Just then the school bell rang. Bob had to let the little
fellow go his own way. There was a special programme for
that morning, and Bob’s mind was full of it. This was the
public reading of a composition on “Ceylon.” A prize was to
be given for the best piece.</p>

<p>On these occasions at times several visitors came to the
school. As he entered, Bob noticed a number of ladies whom
he knew. Seated in a chair near the platform was a young
man smartly dressed, who wore a single eye-glass.</p>

<p>“He’s the English artist staying at Ned Thomas’s house,”
Frank whispered to Bob.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Several scholars read their pieces, Bob among the number.
They were all very good, for the writers were allowed to
consult books, and even get help from others. The story had
to be told in their own language.</p>

<p>Bob noticed that Ned was absent. When Jed Burr’s turn
came, the bully stood up in his usual bold way, and began
drawling out the contents of the written paper in his hand.</p>

<p>Even Bob had to confess to himself that Jed’s paper was
very fine. It told things about Ceylon that the other boys
had not mentioned. Jed read about the wonderful tricks of
the elephants in that country.</p>

<p>As he did this, Bob noticed the English artist straighten
up, fix his eye-glass, and stare at Jed. He was sure he heard
the artist speak the words:</p>

<p>“Ah, extrawordinary, you know!”</p>

<p>When Jed told of how the women of Ceylon worked,
carrying great loads on their backs, the artist said, under his
breath:</p>

<p>“I say, remawkable!”</p>

<p>This puzzled Bob, for the artist kept staring hard at Jed,
and rubbing his head, as if something had happened that he
could not understand.</p>

<p>When recess came the artist went up to Miss Williams.
Bob noticed that he spoke to her quite seriously. Most of the
scholars had gone out onto the playground, and Bob was
about to join them, when the teacher said:</p>

<p>“Will you come here for a moment, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Williams,” he replied, going up to her desk.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Ned Thomas to-day?” asked Miss
Williams.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what kept him from school?”</p>

<p>“I think I half know, Miss Williams, but I don’t care to
say anything about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should speak out, my lad,” said the artist. “Some
wrong work has been going on, and we wish to get at the
bottom of it, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Miss Williams,” spoke Bob; “you had better
ask Ned about it.”</p>

<p>“But he is not here, Bob.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll try and find him.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would, Bob,” said the teacher.</p>

<p>Bob started out on his hunt for the truant. He wondered
a good deal about what was up. Nobody on the playground
had seen Ned. Finally, a boy who lived near by, and who
had run home for a quick bite to eat, told Bob that little Ned
was playing over near a spring in the woods.</p>

<p>Bob came across Ned wading in some water. His feet
were soaked and his clothes muddy. He had been building
a little dam, and he looked reckless and unhappy.</p>

<p>“Teacher wants you, Ned,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see teacher,” spoke Ned, in a sullen way.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“She’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go,” declared the little fellow, starting to wade
deeper into the water.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” said Bob, quickly, catching hold of Ned’s
arm. “See here, don’t be a gump. The artist who boards
down at your house is up at the schoolhouse with the teacher.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is he?” cried Ned, brightening up. “I’ll go, then,
Bob.”</p>

<p>All the scholars looked curious as Bob crossed the playground
with Ned in his charge.</p>

<p>“Close the door. Bob,” spoke Miss Williams, as Bob led
Ned into the schoolroom. “You can remain, if you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob sat down at one of the desks. In a halting, shame-faced
way Ned hunched up to the teacher.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to play hookey. It wasn’t my fault,” he
blurted out.</p>

<p>“Ah, my lad,” here spoke the artist, “you know I was a bit&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;surprised,
don’t you know, and I wanted to awsk
you something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” blubbered Ned, humbly, with eyes cast down.</p>

<p>“I gave you some stories of my journey through Ceylon
for your composition, you know. Another lad read them off
here this morning.”</p>

<p>“He stole my paper from me,” burst out Ned. “The mean
bully! He gave me his to read, but I tore it up. I won’t
stand it any longer,” and Ned began to bawl.</p>

<p>“It’s a clear case, Miss,” said the artist. “A&mdash;ah, er&mdash;decidedly
mean theft. This Thistle boy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Burr,” corrected the teacher, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, Burr. He should be exposed, Miss.”</p>

<p>“I think the school board will expel him when they know
the facts of the case,” said the teacher.</p>

<p>“Won’t he be boss of ‘The Blues’ any more, then?” asked
Ned, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I fancy not,” replied Miss Williams.</p>

<p>“Then I ain’t afraid any more,” cried Ned. “I’ll tell the
truth; yes, I will. I’ve been a mean boy, but Jed Burr made
me that. He got me to play all kinds of tricks on the scholars;
and say, Miss Williams,” added Ned, with a quick glance at
Bob, “Jed stole a spelling list from your desk, and some of
his fellows copied it, and Jed got me to put it in Bob
Bouncer’s desk, so as to get him into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob!” cried Miss Williams, coming up to him
and putting out her hand, “I have wronged you very
greatly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it, Miss Williams,” replied Bob, smiling
loyally. “It’s all right now, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You are a noble boy, Bob,” said his teacher.</p>

<p>“I think it’s myself that wronged somebody,” said Bob to
himself, as he left the schoolhouse. “Here I went and suspected
poor Tom Chubb of what he never did. A fine
friend I am! I’m going to tell him how mean I’ve been.”</p>

<p>Tom thought Bob quite the best friend he had heard of,
when Bob told his story.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t tell on a friend, would you?” said Tom. “The
only mistake was your thinking I was smart enough to get
hold of that spelling list.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t very smart in Jed Burr, the way it has turned
out,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” echoed Sammy. “It pays to be straight.”</p>

<p>At noon Jed Burr was sent home with a note to his
parents. It told that he was suspended from school until the
school board were told of his unfairness and misdoings.</p>

<p>Bob felt that something more than being sorry was due
to Tom. He invited him and Frank and Sammy to tea to
his house that evening.</p>

<p>The four boys were playing a game of tennis just at dusk,
when they heard a yell down the road. Bob ran out to the
gate.</p>

<p>A man was coming pell-mell down the middle of the road.
He was waving his arms wildly.</p>

<p>“Hurry, run!” he shouted, as he espied the boys.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” bawled Sammy.</p>

<p>“Fire!” yelled the runner, never stopping to take breath.
“At the schoolhouse&mdash;it’s on fire, and burning up!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="pch">THE CAPTURE&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> mischief!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Schoolhouse burning up!” echoed Sammy. “That’s big
news.”</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” ordered Frank, making a rush down
the road.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for me,” said Tom. “I’m too fat to run fast.”</p>

<p>“Say, I don’t see any blaze,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“No, but look&mdash;everybody is putting for the schoolhouse!”
cried Sammy.</p>

<p>This was true. In the dim dusk they could see men,
women and children rushing in the direction of the schoolhouse.
They could hear the man who had told the news,
and others, shouting nearer to the center of the village.</p>

<p>The news seemed to spread like wildfire. Just as the
boys joined the procession hurrying to the schoolhouse, they
caught the echo of a great clanging and clatter.</p>

<p>“They’ve got the hose-cart out,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“The schoolhouse is on fire!” cried Sammy.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” added Frank.</p>

<p>They were now in full sight of the school building. From
one end a great volume of smoke was pouring out of the
windows. Then, just as they bounded over the fence, one of
a dozen men already come upon the scene, ran at a door and
kicked it in.</p>

<p>At once the flames came out in a sheet. Some one shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for buckets. Bob knew where there was one under the
school building, in use when people drove to the school and
wanted to water their horses. He got it out quickly and ran
to the pump.</p>

<p>“Help me, Frank,” he called.</p>

<p>Frank and Sammy took turns in pumping. Bob ran with
the pail to a man at the broken-in door. The man threw the
water inside and Bob went back after more water. Then
two men arrived with buckets from the nearest house, and
soon half a dozen pails were in use.</p>

<p>Men took the place of the boys and crowded them out
of service, but they had done their part.</p>

<p>“What’s that, now?” spoke Bob, as, rounding the building,
they came to the little addition to the main school
building, used as a storeroom.</p>

<p>“Why,” shouted Sammy, “there’s some one inside!”</p>

<p>“It looks so,” spoke Frank, in wonder.</p>

<p>Bang, clatter, crash!&mdash;the rear window of the storeroom
was smashed out from inside. A man leaped into view. He
must have been sleeping in the place, and the fire must have
started between the storeroom and the schoolhouse door. He
could not get past it, and had broken out that way.</p>

<p>The flames showed the man plainly. He was a stranger
to Fairview, and had a green patch over one eye. As he
jumped from the window he stumbled and fell to the ground.
He was on his feet at once. Then he started to run away
from the spot.</p>

<p>“Say, I know him!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“One of the robbers!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” spoke Sammy.</p>

<p>“Stop that man&mdash;stop that man!” yelled Bob at the top
of his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>He and his friends ran after the fellow. The rascal’s
way was blocked, and he was caught and held by two men
who had heard Bob’s cries.</p>

<p>“Aha! who are you?” demanded one of the captors.</p>

<p>“I’m only a poor tramp. Went into the schoolhouse to
get warm.”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the men who robbed Mr. Haven’s jewelry
store,” declared Bob, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Is that so!” exclaimed the man’s captor.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>

<p>“Bob, here comes the marshal,” spoke Frank just then.</p>

<p>“And the hose-cart,” added Sammy.</p>

<p>Bob ran to meet the marshal. He told much that made
the officer very anxious to take the man with the green shade
over one eye in charge. The hose-cart men soon attacked the
fire, which had been caused by some hot coals falling on
the floor from the big stove in the schoolroom. Soon the
blaze was put out.</p>

<p>“You stay with me, Bob,” said the marshal, keeping tight
hold of his prisoner. “I want to question this fellow. You
seem to know more about him than any one else.”</p>

<p>The marshal led the man to the nearest house. Its owner
took them into a sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Bob,” said the marshal, “you are sure this is
the man you saw with two satchels the night you told me
about?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“My man,” asked the marshal, “what did you do with
those satchels?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to get myself into trouble by telling,”
replied the robber, sullenly.</p>

<p>“You’re in pretty bad trouble already, if you only knew
it,” said the marshal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, supposing I tell?”</p>

<p>“It will be the easier for you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t break into the jewelry store.”</p>

<p>“Who did?”</p>

<p>“My partner.”</p>

<p>“Very well, tell us where he is, and about those satchels,
and we’ll make it as light for you as we can.”</p>

<p>“Is that a bargain?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the man with the green shade over his
eye. “I dropped them under the pump platform into the
schoolhouse well.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ward,” said Bob, quickly, to the marshal, “send for
a well-cleaner, and see if he is telling the truth.”</p>

<hr class="d5" />

<p>“Say, Bob, the whole town is talking about you,” spoke
Frank Haven.</p>

<p>“Are they?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I should think they would!” cried Sammy Brown. “Why,
you’ve done the biggest thing ever done in Fairview.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” said Bob, flushing up, “you’re making too
much of nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing?” echoed Frank. “Do you call it nothing saving
my father from ruin, Bob Bouncer?”</p>

<p>“Have I done that?”</p>

<p>“Father says so, and he sent us down to bring you right up
to the house.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“He wants to pay you that reward.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Bob, “he simply can’t do it. Do you suppose
I’d let the father of my best chum pay me for what any
boy would be glad to do? I guess not, Frank Haven!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“He wants to see you, anyway, so you’ve got to come
along.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” put in Tom Chubb. “No getting out of
it, Bob.”</p>

<p>The others surrounded Bob and marched him down the
street. A dozen people met him and shook hands with him.
They met Minnie Grey, who called Bob “a hero,” and cried,
as she always did when Bob met with “good luck,” as she
called it. Little crippled Benny Lane cheered Bob with a
dozen hurrahs as they passed his home.</p>

<p>The satchels had been found in the schoolhouse well, and
only a few pieces of jewelry were missing. The captured
robber was now in jail, and the marshal and his men were
looking for his partner.</p>

<p>It came out that the tramp had heard Silas Dolby tell
about the lost key to the jewelry store, and had found it in
his garden. He had been given shelter in the old miser’s
barn, because Mr. Dolby was afraid to refuse him, he was
such a rough, ugly fellow.</p>

<p>When the boys reached Frank’s home, Mr. Haven came
out and met them. He grasped both of Bob’s hands, all
smiles, and as happy as he could be.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob,” he said, “I suppose you’ve come for that
reward?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent of it, Mr. Haven,” replied Bob, firmly.</p>

<p>“I have decided to give you one hundred dollars, Bob.
The balance, I suppose, should go to the marshal and his
men.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Haven,” said Bob, “my father told me that if I took
so much as a cent from a good neighbor like you, he’d invite
me out to the barn with a strap.”</p>

<p>“Why, the town would mob him if he laid a finger on its
hero!” declared Mr. Haven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Bob, “but you know I must obey my
parents.”</p>

<p>Mr. Haven was silent for a moment or two. He looked
over the four fine-spirited lads in a proud and kindly way.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, as you won’t have the reward, I shall go to
work on a new plan. I intend to have the loft of the old barn
fixed up nice and tidy for a clubroom for you and your
friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, that will be fine!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Famous!” echoed Sammy.</p>

<p>“I shall spend the hundred dollars getting you the best
gymnasium outfit it will buy,” added Mr. Haven.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Tom Chubb.</p>

<p>“Vacation until they fix up the schoolhouse, and that
grand gymnasium to think of!” said Sammy Brown. “Say,
fellows, we’re having the finest time on earth!”</p>

<p>Then the boys gave three rousing cheers for Frank
Haven’s father, and started out on a new round of healthy
fun and adventure, as will be related in the next volume of
this series, to be called, “Fairview Boys at Camp Mystery;
Or, The Old Hermit and His Secret.”</p>

<p>“We are bound to have lots more of fun and excitement,”
said Bob Bouncer.</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
